REUTERS\/Marco Bello Marco Bello\/Reuters\n\nThe New York attorney general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawsuit alleges Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida was valued \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as high as $739 million based on the false premise that it was unrestricted property and could be developed and sold for residential use,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and continues, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in reality, the club generated annual revenues of less than $25 million and should have been valued at closer to $75 million.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n2.

In reality, the apartment had an area of less than 11,000 square feet, something that Mr. Trump was well aware of,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d James said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment in 2015, in 2016, was $327 million. To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n3.

But Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company claimed in subsequent financial statements that the property was worth roughly $292 million, according to the lawsuit. The property near Central Park includes high-end residential units, commercial spaces and storage spaces.\n\n4.

It became a hub for his supporters and close contacts, and bookings grew because of the connection to the sitting president.\n\n5.

Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company got appraisals for the property in 2010 and 2012, which found that it was worth $200 million and $220 million respectively, according to the lawsuit. But Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company repeatedly claimed that the property was worth a lot more in its official financial statements, according to the lawsuit.\n\n7. Trump golf courses\n\nThe presidential limousine is parked at the Trump National Jupiter Golf Club & Spa in Jupiter, Florida, on February 11, 2017. Susan Walsh\/AP\n\nThe lawsuit argues the Trump Organization also used a variety of deceptive or inappropriate methods to inflate the value of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golf courses. For example, the organization added 30% to the value of various golf courses to account for a Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brand premium,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d despite what the suit describes as rules against such practices. Trump claimed a club, Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, purchased for $5 million in 2012 jumped to a worth of a $62 million in 2013.\n\n8.

Clary\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nMany of the Trump Organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ventures involve licensing deals, in which another party owns the property and pays Trump to use his brand. The lawsuit alleges that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business inflated the value of its overall licensing business by including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speculative and non-existent deals\u00e2\u20ac\u009d between 2015 and 2018. Some of those speculative deals involved potential overseas arrangements. The suit argues that including them in the valuations in 2016 and 2017 was misleading because the Trump Organization purportedly stopped seeking foreign deals after Trump took office. The licensing deals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 value were further boosted by including deals between business entities owned by the Trump Organization, according to the suit. According to former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153licensing was generally handled by Ivanka\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were well aware of the actual revenue derived from licensing in general, according to the lawsuit.\"\n","ESG_RELEVANT":1,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Child labour","SCALE":"Minor","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Medium","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Labour rights and supply chain","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"Trump","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Minor","FLAG":"Green","FLAG_SCORE":6.0,"name":"Trump"}]
