Wells Fargo and GreatBanc entered into the settlement without\nadmitting or denying the allegations made by the department.\n\n\n\nThe action follows an investigation by the department\u2019s Employee Benefits\nSecurity Administration that determined Wells Fargo and GreatBanc Trust\nCompany caused the 401(k) plan to pay between $1,033 and $1,090 per share for\nWells Fargo preferred stock. Specifically designed for the plan, the stock\nconverted to a set value of $1,000 in Wells Fargo common stock when allocated\nto participants. In transactions between 2013 and 2018, the plan borrowed\nmoney from Wells Fargo to purchase the preferred stock.\n\n\n\nIn addition to its discovery that Wells Fargo and GreatBanc caused the plan to\npay more for stock than it would be worth when deposited in participants\u2019\naccounts, EBSA investigators learned Wells Fargo used the dividends paid on\nthe preferred shares to defray its obligation to make contributions to the\n401(k) plan, by using the dividends to repay the stock purchase loans. The\ninvestigation revealed the transaction was designed to cause the 401(k) plan\nto pay more for each share of stock than plan participants would ever receive.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur investigation found those responsible for Wells Fargo\u2019s 401(k) plan paid\nmore than fair market value for employer stock and, by doing so, betrayed the\ntrust of the plan\u2019s current and future retirees,\u201d said Secretary of Labor\nMarty Walsh. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement shows the Department of Labor will act when\nwe find retirement assets are misused and benefit plans suffer.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Wells Fargo pays the settlement amount to the trust, the funds will be\nallocated to current and former participants affected by these transactions.\nWells Fargo will redeem the remaining convertible preferred stock for common\nstock and will stop using dividends from the convertible preferred shares to\nrepay the stock purchase loans.\n\n\n\nIn addition, GreatBanc will not act as a fiduciary to a public company in\nconnection with any future leveraged transaction involving an employee stock\nownership plan, unless the plan acquires only publicly traded stock and pays\nno more than the fair market value.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen plan fiduciaries\u2019 actions violate participants and beneficiaries\u2019 trust,\nthe Office of the Solicitor will take appropriate action,\u201d said Solicitor of\nLabor Seema Nanda. \u201cThis settlement reflects the Department of Labor\u2019s resolve\nto protect America\u2019s workers\u2019 hard-earned retirement savings and to ensure\nthat plan fiduciaries comply with their legal requirements.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act requires, and participants\u2019\nretirement security demands, that when retirement plans purchase employer\nstock, they pay no more than fair market value,\u201d said Acting Assistant\nSecretary for Employee Benefits Security Ali Khawar. \u201cThis settlement\ndemonstrates that the Employee Benefits Security Administration will not allow\nparticipants to be harmed by ERISA plans that overpay for plan assets.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmployers and workers can reach EBSA toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with\nproblems related to private sector retirement and health plans.

The findings follow an investigation by OSHA's\nChicago Regional Office that was initiated after receiving a complaint from\nthe employee.\n\n\n\nOSHA found Wells Fargo violated the whistleblower protection provisions of the\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Act when it terminated the senior manager who had repeatedly\nvoiced concerns to area managers and the corporate ethics line regarding\nconduct they believed violated relevant financial laws, including wire fraud.\nThe manager expressed concerns that they were directed to falsify customer\ninformation and alleged that management was engaged in price fixing and\ninterest rate collusion through exclusive dealing.\n\n\n\nEven though the manager believed the conduct was illegal based on company-\nrequired training, they were terminated in 2019. After initially failing to\nprovide a reason for the termination, Wells Fargo later alleged the manager\nwas terminated as part of a restructuring process. However, investigators\nfound the removal was not consistent with Wells Fargo's treatment of other\nmanagers removed under the initiative. The employee filed a complaint with\nOSHA, alleging retaliation under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n\n\n\"The evidence demonstrates Wells Fargo took retaliatory action against this\nsenior manager for repeatedly expressing concerns about financial management\nthey believed violated federal laws,\" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for\nOccupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. \"The Sarbanes-Oxley Act protects\nemployees from retaliation in these very circumstances and the Department of\nLabor will not tolerate employers who violate the law and illegally terminate\nworkers that exercise their rights under the law.\"\n\n\n\nBoth parties have 30 days from the receipt of OSHA's findings to file\nobjections and request a hearing before an administrative law judge.\n\n\n\nOSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program enforces the whistleblower provisions\nof the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act and more than 20 whistleblower statutes. These\nstatutes protect employees from retaliation for reporting violations of\nworkplace safety and health, aviation safety, commercial motor carrier,\nconsumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health\ninsurance reform, motor vehicle safety, nuclear, pipeline, public\ntransportation agency, railroad, maritime, securities, tax, criminal\nantitrust, and anti-money laundering laws; as well as for engaging in other\nrelated protected activities.\n\n\n\nLearn more about whistleblower protections.\n\n\n\n# # #\n\n\n\n\n\n_**Editor's note:** The U.S. Department of Labor does not release names of\nemployees involved in whistleblower complaints._\n\n\n\n **Media Contacts:**\n\n\n\nScott Allen, 312-353-4727, allen.scott@dol.gov  \nRhonda Burke, 312-353-4807, burke.rhonda@dol.gov\n\n\n\nRelease Number: 22-1770-NAT\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Labor news materials are accessible at http:\/\/www.dol.gov.\nThe department's Reasonable Accommodation Resource Center converts\ndepartmental information and documents into alternative formats, which include\nBraille and large print.

But according to the attorney general's office, a 2015 inspection found\nthat Walmart continued to dump waste illegally.\n\n\n\n\"Walmart is a responsible corporate citizen in California and everywhere we\noperate. We take our obligation to protect the environment seriously and have\nindustry-leading processes in place to comply with local, state and federal\nenvironmental laws,\" Hargrove said.\n\n\n\nSince 2015, California investigators said 58 inspections of trash compactors\ntaken from Walmart stores found dozens of items classified as either hazardous\nwaste, medical waste or customer records with personal information.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":2.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Owners should park their vehicles outside until they are repaired\n\n\n\nAugust 23, 2022 | Washington, DC\n\n\n\nHyundai Motor America and Kia America recommend that owners of select Model\nYear 2020-2022 Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride vehicles park their cars\noutside and away from homes and other structures until their vehicles have\nbeen repaired, due to new recalls for the risk of fire.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a \u201cstop sale\u201d is being issued as of today\u2019s filing, in\naccordance with federal regulations, for affected unsold vehicles at dealers\nand vehicle processing centers.\n\n\n\nThe recalls involve 245,030 Model Year 2020-2022 Hyundai Palisade vehicles\n(NHTSA ID: 22V-633) and 36,417 Model Year 2020-2022 Kia Telluride vehicles\n(NHTSA ID: 22V-626).

After spending years as a regular ol'\ncar fanatic, he started working his way through the echelons of the automotive\nindustry, starting out as social-media director of a small European-focused\ngarage outside of Chicago. From there, he moved to the editorial side, penning\nseveral written features in Total 911 Magazine before becoming a full-time\nauto writer, first for a local Chicago outlet and then for CNET Cars.\n\n\n\nWhile there's nothing quite as satisfying as pulling a console-mounted\nmechanical handbrake or pressing down on a floor-mounted one, most modern\nvehicles have moved to electronic parking brakes activated via cabin switches.\nThat frees up a lot of space for interior designers to work with, but it\ndoesn't make it problem-free.\n\n\n\nToyota and Lexus have issued a recall for approximate 84,000 vehicles. This\nrecall covers both the 2022 Toyota Tundra pickup and the 2022 Lexus NX250 and\nNX350 compact SUVs. At the moment, it's unclear if the recalled vehicles have\nsequential VINs or build dates.\n\n\n\nThe problem stems from the electronic parking brake. According to Toyota's\npress release (the official Part 573 Safety Recall Report has yet to be posted\nto NHTSA's website), the electronic parking brake may not engage in the\naforementioned vehicles. A parking brake that cannot be set violates federal\nregulations on parking brakes, and it could result in a vehicle rolling away,\nwhich increases the risk of a crash.\n\n\n\nWhile Toyota did not mention a reason for the electronic parking brake's\nfailure to set, it did mention that a remedy is already established.

(Walmart) alleging the improper collection of\nPennsylvania sales tax on sales of 5-Hour Energy drinks.1 On behalf of a class\nof taxpayers, the taxpayer asserted that Walmart\u2019s collection of sales tax on\ndietary supplements violated the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and\nConsumer Protection Law (UTPCPL) and also amounted to conversion, unjust\nenrichment and breach of constructive trust under common-law claims. However,\nthe Court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted, finding that a retailer\u2019s incorrect collection of sales tax is\nnot conduct covered by the UTPCPL, and that the taxpayer could seek a sales\ntax refund through a state administrative process.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn two separate occasions in late 2019 and early 2020, taxpayer Christopher\nLisowski purchased 5-Hour Energy drinks from a Walmart store in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania. During both transactions, Walmart charged the taxpayer sales tax\nat a rate of 7%.2 The taxpayer argued that sales of 5-Hour Energy drinks are\nexempt from Pennsylvania sales and use tax because the drink is marketed as a\ndietary supplement. The taxpayer cited to Pennsylvania Department of Revenue\n(Department) guidance confirming that dietary supplements and substitutes, in\nany form, are exempt from sales tax.3 Walmart nonetheless charged sales tax on\nsales of the drinks, forming the basis of the taxpayer\u2019s federal class action\nlawsuit.  \n  \nBefore the Court, Walmart filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.4 In federal court, a motion to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim is a defense available under the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.5 While the defense does not resolve the underlying\nquestions of law, the court must determine whether the plaintiff has \u201cplead a\nplausible claim for relief.\u201d6  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his complaint, the taxpayer first argued that the UTPCPL protects consumers\nfrom the allegedly improper collection of Pennsylvania sales and use tax.\nSpecifically, the taxpayer alleged that Walmart\u2019s conduct violated the\nprovision of the consumer protection law prohibiting unfair or deceptive\nactivity \u201cin the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d7 In response, Walmart\nargued that the UTPCPL does not cover sales and use taxes because collection\nof sales and use taxes is not act in the conduct of \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d\nregulated by the UTPCPL.  \n  \nFor purposes of the motion to dismiss, the court assumed that sales of 5-Hour\nEnergy drinks are not taxable and that Walmart incorrectly collected sales\ntax.8 The UTPCPL protects consumers from unfair and deceptive practices in\n\u201ctrade or commerce,\u201d defined as the advertising, sale or distribution of\nservices or products.9 Although there was no question that Walmart engages in\n\u201ctrade or commerce,\u201d the Court ultimately determined that Walmart\u2019s collection\nof sales tax was not an act in the conduct of such commercial activity.\nAcknowledging that Pennsylvania courts have not directly addressed the\nUTPCPL\u2019s \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d limitation in the context of a case alleging\nimproper collection of sales tax, the Court considered a recent federal court\ndecision applying Pennsylvania law. In that case, the court ruled that the\ncollection of sales tax did not qualify as \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d under the\nUTPCPL.10 The court reasoned that retailers collect sales tax because they are\nrequired to do so by law and they receive no benefit or profit from collecting\nsuch taxes.  \n  \nThe Court also cited approvingly to several state court decisions which\ndetermined that similar state consumer protection laws \u2013 all based on the\nFederal Trade Commission Act \u2013 do not cover the collection of sales and use\ntaxes.11 The Court found these decisions to be persuasive and consistent with\nthe language of the UTPCPL. Based on these decisions, the Court concluded that\nthe UTPCPL did not regulate activity disconnected from Walmart\u2019s commercial\ninterests, including tax collection.  \n  \nThe Court likewise rejected the taxpayer\u2019s arguments that the Pennsylvania\nFair Credit Extension Uniformity Act (FCEUA) allows enforcement under the\nUTPCPL, and that Walmart profited from the collection of sales and use taxes.\nThe Court concluded that the FCEUA included no language indicating that the\ncollection of sales taxes is actionable under the UTPCPL. Additionally, the\nCourt concluded that any tax credits received by Walmart in collecting sales\ntax was in its capacity as a retailer collecting taxes for the state and was\n\u201cmotivated by a public duty rather than private gain.\u201d12 For these reasons,\nthe Court dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s UTPCPL claim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taxpayer\u2019s other claims were based in common law, a system of judicially\ncreated laws based on fairness principles. Here, the taxpayer alleged the\ncommon-law claims of conversion, unjust enrichment, and breach of constructive\ntrust. In response, Walmart contended that a statutory remedy was available to\nthe taxpayer under Pennsylvania law, thus barring his common-law claims.  \n  \nThe Court agreed that the taxpayer\u2019s common-law claims were barred because\nPennsylvania law provides an adequate remedy in the form of requesting a\nrefund of improperly collected sales tax from the Department. Pursuant to the\nPennsylvania Statutory Construction Act, where Pennsylvania law provides a\nstatutory remedy, all common-law claims are barred.13  \n  \nAfter determining that Pennsylvania\u2019s statutory-remedy rule is substantive law\nthat may be applied in federal court, the Court considered the issue of\nwhether Pennsylvania law provides an exclusive and adequate remedy to the\ntaxpayer. Under Pennsylvania\u2019s law, taxpayers may petition the Department for\na refund of overpaid tax to which the Commonwealth is not entitled.14 First,\nthe Court found that the relevant statutory provisions established a \u201cclear\nprocedure\u201d for taxpayers to obtain refunds of improperly collected sales tax.\nNext, the Court concluded that the available remedy was \u201cexclusive\u201d and\n\u201cadequate\u201d as supported by Pennsylvania case law.15 Accordingly, the Court\nconcluded that the taxpayer was not permitted to any common-law relief and\ndismissed the remaining claims.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dismissal of the _Lisowski_ case is representative of a growing trend by\nfederal courts to dismiss sales tax cases or deny injunctive relief where an\nalternative remedy is available to the taxpayer at the state level.16 In\ngranting Walmart\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court foreclosed any future\npossibility of a class action lawsuit in federal court.17 Reasoning that\nretailers collect sales tax as agents of the Commonwealth, the Court also\nrefused to expand the scope of Pennsylvania\u2019s consumer protection law to\ninclude sales tax collection. Ultimately, the Court\u2019s decision is\nrepresentative of the high bar that exists for sales tax cases to proceed in\nfederal court, a forum that many consider to be more taxpayer-friendly with\nrespect to state tax matters than state administrative tribunals or state\ncourts.  \n  \nWithout an option to pursue their claims in federal court, impacted taxpayers\nare limited to filing refund petitions individually with the Department, which\ncarries its own restrictions and drawbacks. Pennsylvania\u2019s administrative\npetition process does not allow class actions and taxpayers must file refund\npetitions within a three-year period from the date which the tax was paid.18\nAllowing taxpayers to sue under the UTPCPL or under common-law causes of\naction may have exposed Walmart and similar retailers to potentially large\ndamage amounts if the taxpayers were ultimately successful on the merits of\nthe lawsuit. From the taxpayer\u2019s perspective, a federal court class action\nlawsuit would have been a more procedurally efficient process for seeking\nrelief given the larger aggregate tax dollars at stake.  \n  \nFor smaller appeals where a relatively minor amount of sales tax is at issue,\nthe costs of filing a refund petition would greatly exceed the amount of the\npotential refund sought on an individual basis. In theory, retailers may\nsystematically charge sales tax on certain allegedly non-taxable products,\nwhich may not be revealed or addressed until a state audit, because individual\ntaxpayers would lack the incentive to pursue such refunds. Likewise, states\nincluding Pennsylvania are not motivated to provide credits to vendors for\nover-collected sales tax under audit based on revenue collection\nconsiderations. From a consumer protection perspective, the practical issues\npresented in the _Lisowski_ case may provide potential reasons for adjusting\nthe administrative tax appeals process to allow for class action lawsuits and\nother reforms in order to facilitate greater retailer accountability without\nunduly burdening retailers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 _Lisowski v. Walmart Stores_ , No. 2:20-cv-1729-NR, U.S. District Court for\nthe Western District of Pennsylvania, Aug. 4, 2021.  \n2 The 7% sales tax rate consists of a 6% state rate plus an additional 1%\nlocal rate levied by Allegheny County.  \n3 See Form REV-717, _Retailers\u2019 Information Guide_ , Pennsylvania Department\nof Revenue, Feb. 2021; 72 PA. STAT. \u00a7 7204(29).  \n4 Walmart also argued that the taxpayer\u2019s claims are barred by the voluntary-\npayment doctrine and because the taxpayer failed to allege deceptive conduct\nor justifiable reliance to support a UTPCPL claim, but the court did not\nconsider these arguments since it dismissed the lawsuit on other grounds.  \n5 FED.

App. 2011).  \n12 Prior to August 1, 2016, retailers received a tax credit equal to 1% of all\nsales tax collected from each consumer under Pennsylvania law. In August 2016,\nthe law was changed to provide retailers with a flat $25-per-month tax credit,\nregardless of the amount of tax collected. 72 PA. STAT. \u00a7 7227.  \n13 1 PA. CONS.

Commonwealth_ , 354 A.2d 250 (Pa. 1976).  \n16 For example, another Pennsylvania federal court dismissed a sales tax\nlawsuit by the Online Merchants Guild against the Department seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief over the Department\u2019s sales tax registration\ndemands of remote sellers. _Online Merchants Guild v. Hassell_ , No.\n1:21-CV-369, U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania,\ndismissed May 28, 2021. Earlier this year, an Illinois federal court refused\nto grant a temporary restraining order against California for pursuing back\nsales taxes from a Chicago-based online merchant, citing that the federal Tax\nInjunction Act constrains the court from enjoining a tax when a remedy is\navailable in state court. _Rubinas v. Maduros_ , No. 21-CV-96, U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois, motion denied Jan. 18, 2021.  \n17 The taxpayer\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the\ntaxpayer may not address the issues with its complaint or re-file the\ncomplaint. A dismissal with prejudice is typically reserved for a lawsuit in\nwhich the court determines there are no judiciable questions to resolve.  \n18 It should be noted that Pennsylvania provides retailers the first right to\nfile refund claims for over-reported sales tax, but that right may be assigned\nto the customer. This provides a so-called \u201cgroup refund\u201d procedure whereby\nthe retailer returns the over-collected sales tax to the applicable customers\nif successful on the refund claim. However, customers are forced to pursue\nsales tax refunds individually where retailers decline to do so and assign\ntheir rights to the customer.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare with your network\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nSubmit RFP\n\n\n\nRFP\n\n\n\nPartner and National SALT Practice Indirect Tax Services Leader  \n\n\n\nMatthew Melinson is a partner in Grant Thornton's Philadelphia office and the\nnational leader of the SALT practice's indirect tax services.

In its lawsuit, the FTC alleges that for\nyears, the company turned a blind eye while scammers took advantage of its\nfailure to properly secure the money transfer services offered at Walmart\nstores. The company did not properly train its employees, failed to warn\ncustomers, and used procedures that allowed fraudsters to cash out at its\nstores, according to the FTC\u2019s complaint. The FTC is asking the court to order\nWalmart to return money to consumers and to impose civil penalties for\nWalmart\u2019s violations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile scammers used its money transfer services to make off with cash,\nWalmart looked the other way and pocketed millions in fees,\u201d said Samuel\nLevine, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cConsumers have\nlost hundreds of millions, and the Commission is holding Walmart accountable\nfor letting fraudsters fleece its customers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its retail business, Walmart offers financial services to\nconsumers in its stores, including money transfers, credit cards, reloadable\ndebit cards, check cashing, bill payments and more. Walmart acts as an agent\nfor multiple money transfer services, including MoneyGram, Ria and Western\nUnion, offering some services under its own brand, like \u201cWalmart2Walmart\u201d and\n\u201cWalmart2World.\u201d According to the complaint, tens of millions of money\ntransfers are sent or received at Walmart stores each year, where they are\nprocessed by Walmart employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney transfers are services that people use to send money to a recipient in\nanother location. They are frequently used by fraudsters across a wide variety\nof scams because they are nearly impossible to retrieve after the money has\nbeen picked up. The FTC has brought multiple cases against money transfer\nservices in recent years, including against MoneyGram and Western Union,\nalleging they failed to protect consumers who used their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalmart\u2019s practice of turning a blind eye to fraud had grave consequences for\nconsumers, according to the complaint. The complaint cites numerous instances\nin which law enforcement investigations found that scammers relied on Walmart\nmoney transfers as a primary way to receive payments, including in\ntelemarketing schemes like IRS impersonation schemes, relative-in-need\n\u201cgrandparent\u201d scams, sweepstakes scams, and others. Based on information from\nfraud databases maintained by MoneyGram, Western Union, and Ria, from 2013 to\n2018 more than $197 million in payments that were the subject of fraud\ncomplaints were sent or received at Walmart, with more than $1.3 billion in\nrelated payments also possibly connected to the fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FTC\u2019s investigation of Walmart\u2019s money transfer practices showed,\naccording to the complaint, that Walmart knew about the role money transfer\nservices play in scams and frauds. Despite that, the company\u2019s money transfer\nservices harmed consumers in numerous ways, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission vote to file the civil penalty complaint was 3-2, with\nCommissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine S. Wilson dissenting. The FTC\nfiled the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nIllinois.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and\neducate consumers.

Yandle of the\nSouthern District of Illinois, will be divided up among 4,000 women who were\ndenied pregnancy accommodations while working at Walmart between March 2013\nand March 2014. It will also cover the legal fees and other costs involved in\nreaching the settlement.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis sends a clear message to employers across the country about why\npregnancy accommodations have to be a focus, and why pregnant workers\u2019 health\nand safety is a key issue for businesses,\u201d said Emily Martin, a lawyer at the\nNational Women\u2019s Law Center and part of the legal team that represented the\nworkers.\n\n\n\nWalmart, which has overhauled its pregnancy accommodation policies, admitted\nno wrongdoing as part of the settlement.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy both sides could come together to reach a resolution,\u201d the\nretailer said in a statement as part of a joint news release with the\norganization A Better Balance, which represented the workers along with the\nNational Women\u2019s Law Center and Mehri & Skalet, PLLC. \u201cWalmart has had a\nstrong policy against discrimination in place for many years and we continue\nto be a great place for women to work and advance.\u201d\n\n\n\nUntil March 2014, Walmart explicitly excluded pregnant employees from\naccommodations it offered to employees with disabilities or injuries that\nprevented them from performing certain jobs. The policy described pregnancy as\na medical condition that was not eligible for a reassignment to a lighter-duty\njob or the transfer of certain tasks to other employees.\n\n\n\nThe policy meant that Talisa Borders, then an employee at an Illinois Walmart,\nwas not allowed to hand off heavy-duty lifting to other co-workers when she\nwas pregnant in 2013.\n\n\n\nEarly in her pregnancy, Border had slipped off a ladder during a shift.\nWorried about the safety of her baby, she asked other co-workers to help with\ntasks that required lifting heavy objects or climbing a ladder. After a\nsupervisor noticed, and even after Borders brought in a doctor\u2019s note saying\nshe could not lift more than 25 pounds or climb ladders, Walmart forced her to\ntake an unpaid leave of absence, according to the complaint in the case.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in 2013, a Walmart supervisor refused to accept a doctor\u2019s note\nthat Otisha Woolbright, an employee at a store in Jacksonville, Fla., should\navoid heavy lifting. Woolbright had experienced pain and bleeding early in her\npregnancy, and had been told she was at high risk for miscarriage and should\navoid strenuous work. Woolbright alleges she was told: \u201cIf you can\u2019t do [heavy\nlifting], you can walk out those doors.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was only after Woolbright was injured on the job, while kneeling down and\ncarrying 50-pound trays of rotisserie chickens, that she was given a reprieve,\naccording to the complaint. And after she asked about Walmart\u2019s policies\nrelated to parental leave, she was fired.\n\n\n\nIn January 2014, Borders filed a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, alleging Walmart discriminated against her, in\nviolation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Then, in April, Woolbright also\nfiled a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, alleging that Walmart had\ndiscriminated against her because of her sex.\n\n\n\nThe two women, along with a third plaintiff, Stacey Lewis, of West Virginia,\nare now members of a class of thousands of women who will each be compensated\nan average of $2,200, about seven weeks of pay for the average Walmart\nemployee who works less than 40 hours a week.\n\n\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s court hearing, held via teleconference, attorney Ellen Eardley\nsaid she was proud to return wages to these workers, even if it took seven\nyears.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was worth the wait to help others and bring them relief,\u201d Eardley said.\n\n\n\nWhen the women first brought their claims in 2014, workplace pregnancy\ndiscrimination was a \u201clower-profile issue,\u201d said Martin, who is vice president\nfor education and workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. But in\nthe years since, numerous states have passed bills expanding protections for\npregnant workers. In 2015, the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in _Young v.\nUPS_ made it easier for pregnant workers to bring claims under the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act.\n\n\n\nMartin said the case probably will resonate with pregnant workers nationwide,\nincluding many who are essential workers in low-wage jobs amid the coronavirus\npandemic and are raising questions about how to best protect their health and\nthat of their baby.\n\n\n\nShe also said she hopes the settlement will help build momentum for a federal\nlaw that would establish a pregnant worker\u2019s right to reasonable workplace\naccommodations. While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires an employer to\nprovide pregnant women with the same accommodations as other people limited in\ntheir ability to work, it places a heavy burden on pregnant workers to\ndemonstrate that an employer discriminated.\n\n\n\nThe Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber\nof Commerce, would lift that burden from employees. In past years the bill\nfaced limited bipartisan support, with some lawmakers raising concerns about\nthe burdens on employers.\n\n\n\nBut, Martin said, \u201cI think that world is quickly changing.\u201d\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"MotorBiscuit\n\n\n\nPure Autos\n\n\n\nIf you recently got a new Toyota RAV4, then it might need to head back to the\ndealership for some maintenance. Some 2022 Toyota RAV4 models are under recall\ndue to having an issue that prevents the front passenger\u2019s airbag from\ndeploying correctly.\n\n\n\nIf you own a 2022 Toyota RAV4 model, then you might need to address a\npotential problem. According to AutoBlog, over 3,500 units are at risk due to\nan airbag malfunction that may prevent it from deploying correctly.\n\n\n\nThe at-risk models include the Rav4 Hybrid and Prime models equipped with the\neight-way power seat and height adjustment features. The seats could have a\nstop on the frame that interferes with the occupant sensing system.\n\n\n\nAs a result, it may cause the safety system to be unable to detect an\noccupant. If the system doesn\u2019t sense an occupant, then the airbag may not\ndeploy during a collision, increasing the risk of injuries.\n\n\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shared that it\u2019s\npossible that the stopper and frame near the OSC sensor were assembled with\nvariations that could cause interference leading to the inability of the OSC\nsensor to detect loads.\n\n\n\nOwners of the 2022 Toyota RAV4 models at risk will be notified via mail\nbeginning on September 2, 2022. You can visit the NHSTA site here to enter\nyour 17-digit VIN to see if your RAV4 is affected.\n\n\n\nThe models will need to return to a Toyota dealership for service, but you\ndon\u2019t have to return to the same place where you purchased your SUV. While you\ncan still drive your RAV4 in the meantime, know that the issue prevents the\nSUV from meeting federal motor vehicle safety standard 208.\n\n\n\nThe issue may not occur in every Toyota RAV4 model equipped with the eight-way\npower seat, but at least 70 percent of them could be affected. The problem was\ndiscovered by Toyota engineers, and Toyota is currently unaware of any\ninjuries related to the issue.\n\n\n\nIf your vehicle needs to be serviced, then Toyota technicians will inspect the\npassenger seat as necessary free of charge. Some mechanical components may be\nreplaced, and the sensors might be recalibrated.\n\n\n\nThe 2022 Toyota RAV4 is incredibly safe. In fact, it\u2019s an Insurance Institute\nof Highway Safety Top Safety Pick. It earned a \u2018Good\u2019 score in almost every\nsingle crash simulation, which is the highest score possible.\n\n\n\nPlus, the standard Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 Pre-Collison system received a\nSuperior rating for the ability to detect pedestrians and avoid collisions at\nspeeds of 12, 25, and 37 mph.\n\n\n\nBut the seatbelt system takes a little longer than 60 seconds to initiate and\nneeds a longer duration time.\n\n\n\nAlso, this is the only recall for the 2022 Toyota RAV4 so far. We wouldn\u2019t let\nit impact your confidence in this SUV.

The firms admitted the facts set forth in\ntheir respective SEC orders, acknowledged that their conduct violated\nrecordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, agreed to pay\ncombined penalties of more than $1.1 billion, and have begun implementing\nimprovements to their compliance policies and procedures to settle these\nmatters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFinance, ultimately, depends on trust. By failing to honor their\nrecordkeeping and books-and-records obligations, the market participants we\nhave charged today have failed to maintain that trust,\u201d said SEC Chair Gary\nGensler. \u201cSince the 1930s, such recordkeeping has been vital to preserve\nmarket integrity. As technology changes, it\u2019s even more important that\nregistrants appropriately conduct their communications about business matters\nwithin only official channels, and they must maintain and preserve those\ncommunications. As part of our examinations and enforcement work, we will\ncontinue to ensure compliance with these laws.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe SEC staff\u2019s investigation uncovered pervasive off-channel communications.\nThe firms cooperated with the investigation by gathering communications from\nthe personal devices of a sample of the firms\u2019 personnel. These personnel\nincluded senior and junior investment bankers and debt and equity traders.\n\n\n\nFrom January 2018 through September 2021, the firms\u2019 employees routinely\ncommunicated about business matters using text messaging applications on their\npersonal devices. The firms did not maintain or preserve the substantial\nmajority of these off-channel communications, in violation of the federal\nsecurities laws. By failing to maintain and preserve required records relating\nto their businesses, the firms\u2019 actions likely deprived the Commission of\nthese off-channel communications in various Commission investigations. The\nfailings occurred across all of the 16 firms and involved employees at\nmultiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior executives.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions \u2013 both in terms of the firms involved and the size of the\npenalties ordered \u2013 underscore the importance of recordkeeping requirements:\nthey\u2019re sacrosanct. If there are allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct, we\nmust be able to examine a firm\u2019s books and records to determine what\nhappened,\u201d said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of\nEnforcement. \u201cThese 16 firms not only have admitted the facts and acknowledged\nthat their conduct violated these very important requirements, but have also\nstarted to implement measures to prevent future violations. Other broker\ndealers and asset managers who are subject to similar requirements under the\nfederal securities laws would be well-served to self-report and self-remediate\nany deficiencies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThese actions deliver a straightforward message to registrants: You are\nexpected to abide by the Commission\u2019s recordkeeping rules,\u201d said Sanjay\nWadhwa, Deputy Director of Enforcement. \u201cThe time is now to bolster your\nrecord retention processes and to fix issues that could result in similar\nfuture misconduct by firm personnel. In line with this first-of-its-kind group\nresolution and our December 2021 settlement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,\nthe staff will continue its efforts to enforce compliance with the\nCommission\u2019s essential recordkeeping requirements.\u201d\n\n\n\nEach of the 15 broker-dealers was charged with violating certain recordkeeping\nprovisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and with failing reasonably\nto supervise with a view to preventing and detecting those violations. DWS\nInvestment Management Americas, Inc., the investment adviser, was charged with\nviolating certain recordkeeping provisions of the Investment Advisers of 1940\nand with failing reasonably to supervise with a view to preventing and\ndetecting those violations.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the significant financial penalties, each of the firms was\nordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant\nrecordkeeping provisions and were censured.

Both companies also are\ncharged with making deceptive environmental claims, touting that the \u201cbamboo\u201d\ntextiles were made using ecofriendly processes, while in reality converting\nbamboo into rayon requires the use of toxic chemicals and results in hazardous\npollutants.\n\n\n\nThe Commission has asked the court to order Kohl\u2019s and Walmart to stop making\ndeceptive green claims or using other misleading advertising, and pay\npenalties of $2.5 million and $3 million, respectively, by far the largest\npenalties in this area. The complaints and proposed orders were filed by the\nU.S. Department of Justice on the FTC\u2019s behalf.\n\n\n\n\u201cKohl\u2019s and Walmart are paying millions of dollars under the FTC\u2019s Penalty\nOffense Authority for mislabeling their rayon products as bamboo,\u201d said Samuel\nLevine, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cFalse\nenvironmental claims harm both consumers and honest businesses, and companies\nthat greenwash can expect to pay a price.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe FTC\u2019s complaints against Kohl\u2019s and Walmart are similar in their structure\nand allegations. According to the complaints, since at least January 2015,\nKohl\u2019s, headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, and Walmart, based in\nBentonville, Arkansas, have each marketed at least two dozen items as made of\nbamboo in both product titles and descriptions. In addition, the companies\nhave marketed some of the \u201cbamboo-derived\u201d products as providing general\nenvironment benefits, such as being produced \u201cfree of harmful chemicals, using\nclean, non-toxic materials.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs the complaints allege, Kohl\u2019s and Walmart\u2019s supposed \u201cbamboo\u201d textiles are\nactually made of rayon derived from bamboo, which was not disclosed to\nconsumers, in violation of the FTC Act and the Textile Act and Rules. Further,\nthe complaints allege the claimed environmental benefits of the products are\nfalse and misleading because the rayon manufacturing process uses toxic\nchemicals and results in the emission of hazardous pollutants.\n\n\n\n ** _Enforcement Action_**\n\n\n\nThe proposed orders settling the FTC\u2019s complaints against Kohl\u2019s **** and\nWalmart prohibit the companies from conduct alleged in the complaint.

Over the last six months, the\nCommission has revived this authority and expanded it to address false\nearnings claims, false job placement claims, and deceptive reviews.\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with this announcement, the FTC is reviving additional Notices\nof Penalty Offenses that were issued in the 1970s or 1980s but remain valid\nand relevant today.

However, the park had \u201cno idea\u201d what they were creating at the time.\n\n\n\nHargroves, who starred in the bombshell documentary _Black Fish_ , compared\nthe marine attraction to the fictional events in _Jurassic Park_. As he\ndescribes, the park resorted to unconventional tactics to breed more orcas for\nits live shows that attract millions of visitors to the park every year.\n\n\n\nAccording to Hargroves, after the orcas were captured from the Pacific, they\nwere later bred with Icelandic killer whales. This irresponsible breeding\ncreated whales that would never survive in the wild simply because they don\u2019t\nexist.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Jurassic World. The whole premise of the movie is that they created\nhybrid dinosaurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we did at SeaWorld.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cThe main takeaway with creating a hybrid orca is that you truly\nhave no idea what you\u2019ve created because they don\u2019t exist in nature. So all\nthings are possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition, sadly, SeaWorld orcas were forced to mate with family members due\nto poor planning. In 2007, a mother and son orca produced a calf. However,\nit\u2019s unclear whether the two were able to mate or whether the mother was\nartificially inseminated.\n\n\n\nThree years later, another SeaWorld orca gave birth to a calf after she mated\nwith her uncle. However, she instantly rejected the baby.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, California passed legislation that banned killer whale breeding in\ncaptivity. After, SeaWorld announced that it would stop its breeding programs\nacross all three of its parks.\n\n\n\nSadly, breeding is still legal in countries like Japan and Russia, where\nkiller whales perform in live shows.\n\n\n\nBefore the law passed, Jon Reilly, then president of SeaWorld San Diego, said\nthat \u201ca ban on breeding would sentence these animals to a slow extinction in\nour care.\u201d SeaWorld later announced it was going in a \u201cnew direction,\u201d but\ntheir remaining killer whales would stay at the park.\n\n\n\nSince 1961, nearly 166 orcas have been held in captivity. According to Whales\nand Dolphin Conservation, SeaWorld holds 18 of those whales in its three parks\nacross the country. Out of the 18 orcas at the park, six are hybrid whales and\nare known to be aggressive.\n\n\n\nOne hybrid orca went on to kill its trainer, Alexis Martinez. Later, SeaWorld\nofficials sent another hybrid killer whale to a different park after it\ngrabbed a trainer by the leg. Most of SeaWorld\u2019s orcas were bred in captivity\nusing the sperm of SeaWorld\u2019s most famous orca Tilikum.\n\n\n\nJoin Our Community\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter for new stories, tips & events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 - Outsider - All rights reserved\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Sign in\n\n\n\nThis article was published more than **2 years ago**\n\n\n\nThe family of a Walmart employee who fatally shot himself in 2019 hours after\nbuying a gun from the store has **** sued the retail giant for negligence,\nalleging those at the store knew the man\u2019s history of mental illness and\nrecent threats of suicide yet proceeded with the sale.\n\n\n\nThe family of 23-year-old Jacob Mace alleges a series of breakdown in policies\nand violations of state gun sale laws that could have prevented his death,\naccording to a lawsuit filed in Tuesday in Prince George\u2019s County, Md. Among\nthem were failures by store employees to ask screening questions before the\nsale and to refuse the sale despite allegedly noticing Mace had been drinking\nwhen he bought the gun during a morning break.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the sadder things about this case \u2014 there are multiple points\nlike that,\u201d attorney Kevin Sullivan told The Washington Post on Thursday. \u201cHad\nan opportunity been taken to stop this [sale], the outcome would have been\ndifferent. The most specific is the actual handing over of the firearm, but\nthere were numerous balls that were dropped.\u201d\n\n\n\nShootings never stopped during the pandemic: 2020 was the deadliest gun\nviolence year in decades\n\n\n\nWalmart declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation, but offered\ncondolences to Mace\u2019s family.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken when we lose a member of our Walmart family and our\nthoughts continue to go out to family and loved ones of Jacob Mace,\u201d Walmart\nspokesman Randy Hargrove said in a statement to The Post. \u201cWe are committed to\nbeing a responsible firearms dealer and take these allegations seriously.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit comes as families and policymakers are still grappling with the\nfirearms death toll from 2020, which was America\u2019s deadliest year for gun\nviolence in almost two decades. At least 43,551 people died of gun violence\nlast year, according to the most recent data from the Gun Violence Archive.\nMore than half of those deaths were gun suicides.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, more than half of all suicides are by firearms. Compared\nto other methods that do not as consistently result in death, 85 to 95 percent\nof all suicidal incidents result in death when a gun is used, according to\nMichael D. Anestis, who researches firearms, suicide and public safety at\nRutgers University and is executive director of The New Jersey Gun Violence\nResearch Center.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe typical story of American suicide is a gun that\u2019s already been in the\nhome,\u201d Anestis added. And someone will become suicidal down the road and it\u2019s\nthere, the gun is in the environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMace was married with two young boys. His family had already once taken away a\ngun he owned before he purchased another shotgun from Walmart, according to\nthe lawsuit.\n\n\n\nSullivan, a Maryland-based attorney who partnered with the nonprofit Brady\nCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence in the case, said their lawsuit is not about\nthe Second Amendment but rather public health.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a case that is seeking to stop gun sales,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a case\nthat\u2019s seeking to stop illegal and an irresponsible gun ownership, and that\u2019s\nsomething gun owners and non-gun owners can agree on.\u201d\n\n\n\nWalmart, site of recent shootings, has a complicated history with guns\n\n\n\nWalmart\u2019s history with gun sales is a complicated one. As the world\u2019s largest\nretailer, it\u2019s also considered the biggest seller of firearms and ammunition.\nOver the past 25 years, the company has retreated from gun sales in certain\nmarkets only to resume them in response to both industry and political trends.\n\n\n\nMajor gun retailers like Walmart can play a significant role in affecting gun-\nsale policies across the industry, said Erin C. Davis, a lawyer with Brady who\nis co-counsel in Mace\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\u201cPolicies and procedures implemented by a big company can set the tone for\nsmaller companies. It can have a ripple effect and change lives,\u201d Davis said.\n\u201cNationally, gun dealers have an obligation to act with reasonable care.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was the standard of \u201creasonable care\u201d that Walmart failed to meet, the\nlawsuit claims.\n\n\n\n\u2018I know I don\u2019t need it.\u2019 An AR-15 owner explains the allure.\n\n\n\nMace began working part-time in maintenance at the Walmart store in St. Mary\u2019s\nCounty, Md., in 2018. His family said Mace struggled with depression and\nsuicidal thoughts since childhood, but was formally diagnosed with major\ndepressive disorders and borderline personality disorders in June 2019 while\nworking for Walmart.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit claims Mace had been open with his health struggles with\ncolleagues and even his supervisor, who was allegedly aware that a mental\nhealth crisis was behind a hospitalization stint that forced Mace to miss\nwork, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nMace was allegedly in the midst of an acute mental health crisis in the days\nbefore his death, texting a colleague about \u201ccrippling\u201d depression and\nrevealing he had tried to kill himself that week and would try again with a\ngun. The colleague shared the text with Mace\u2019s supervisor and suggested Mace\nbe added to the store\u2019s discretionary \u201cblacklist,\u201d which it can use to deny\ngun sales to people even if they aren\u2019t barred under state and federal law.\nThe suit alleges Mace was never added to the store\u2019s blacklist.\n\n\n\nThree days before his death, Mace messaged a colleague who worked in firearm\nsales asking what kinds of shotguns Walmart sold and which was \u201ccheapest,\u201d\naccording to the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nRoughly two and a half hours into his morning shift on Nov. 15, 2019, Mace\npurchased a shotgun during his break. Store colleagues noticed Mace appeared\nto have been drinking, but sold him the gun after he passed background checks.\nThe lawsuit alleges employees did not ask Mace basic screening questions about\nhis state of mind or what he wanted the gun for.\n\n\n\nWhen Mace never returned from his break, friends and family called 911 to look\nfor him. He was found little more than two hours after the timestamp on his\nreceipt, inside his truck parked in a nearby lot, the lawsuit says. He died of\na single gunshot wound.\n\n\n\nAnestis said the realities of suicide prevention make assigning\nresponsibilities to specific individuals difficult.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf people who are trained to do this struggle to do it effectively, it\u2019s\ntough to go to people who are outside the field of mental health and expect\nthem to do it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAnestis stressed that suicide is complex but preventable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were several people who did things right,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was the\nfamily who knew [Mace] was having a hard time and took that firearm away. And\nthe friend he texted told someone. And that shows how difficult it is in a\nmoment of crisis for someone to get help.\u201d\n\n\n\n _If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Suicide Prevention\nLifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255).

The increased\nuse of subcontractors, who work under inferior conditions at Raglan Mine, is\nanother key issue in the labour dispute.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has reached the point where there are often many more contractors at the\nmine site than unionized workers. It doesn't make sense. This means fewer\neconomic benefits for the regions of Quebec, while this multinational\ncorporation extracts huge profits by exploiting our natural resources,\u201d said\nEric Savard, president of Steelworkers Local 9449, which represents the\nstriking workers.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the shameful use of subcontractors, other stumbling blocks in\nnegotiations include vacations, working conditions and wages. Above all,\nhowever, workers are demanding respect from Glencore.\n\n\n\n\u201cGlencore has been continually pushing the limits. It even balks at providing\na proper lunch hour to workers who are working 11 hours a day, 21 days in a\nrow. It\u2019s reached the point where those who refuse to work overtime are given\nthe cold shoulder by the bosses. Living conditions at the mining camp have\ndeteriorated over the years. The employer systematically quibbles over the\nliving and working conditions of employees who are away from their families\nfor long periods of time. It\u2019s time for this company to show greater respect\nfor the workers who are generating its profits of tens of millions of dollars\neach year,\u201d Savard added.\n\n\n\nThe parties met on Friday in the presence of a mediator, without breaking the\nimpasse in negotiations. The union members therefore decided to exercise their\nstrike mandate, which they had approved last week by an overwhelming majority\nvote of 97.5%.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are faced with an employer who continually seeks to do as little as\npossible to improve the quality of life of its workers. This employer has even\ntried to divide the workers and turn them against each other. But today, union\nmembers are united and have chosen to walk out, together. And it is united\nthat they will return to the mining camp when they receive the respect they\ndeserve from their employer,\u201d said Steelworkers union representative Harold\nArsenault.\n\n\n\nThe Syndicat des M\u00e9tallos\/United Steelworkers, affiliated with the Quebec\nFederation of Labour, is the largest private-sector union in Quebec,\nrepresenting more than 60,000 workers in all economic sectors.\n\n\n\nClairandr\u00e9e Cauchy, 514 774-4001, ccauchy@metallos.ca\n\n\n\nWorkers cite subcontracting and lack of respect from the employer as key\nissues in the dispute\n\n\n\nClairandr\u00e9e Cauchy, 514 774-4001, ccauchy@metallos.ca\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Other-governance","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Use Google to translate the web site.

Glencore is the\nworld\u2019s biggest supplier of cobalt.\n\n\n\nA report from an IndustriALL fact-finding mission to DRC in February 2018,\nreveals that workers mining cobalt at Glencore\u2019s the Kamoto Copper Company and\nMutanda mines are only allowed 750ml of drinking water per 12-hour shift and\nthat Glencore provides expired food and no decent eating places with\nprotection against the elements.\n\n\n\nThere are no proper showers or ablution facilities at the mines risking\ncontamination and occupational respiratory diseases for workers and their\nfamilies: \u201cWe are so filthy when we get home that we cannot hug our children,\u201d\nsaid one worker.\n\n\n\nThe mission also found workers and their families have to travel 42 kilometres\nto Glencore health facilities, meaning that they must leave in the early hours\nof the morning only to return late at night, and in some instances without\nbeing treated.\n\n\n\nThe mission took place at the urgent request of IndustriALL affiliate TUMEC in\nDRC, which represents workers at both the Kamoto Copper Company and Mutanda\nmines.\n\n\n\nTUMEC is considering strike action over disparities in wages at Glencore\u2019s\nmines in DRC where, for instance, a white supervisor earns US$4,000 a month\nand his immediate Congolese assistants earn US$600 a month.\n\n\n\nThe report outlines Glencore\u2019s disrespect for the collective bargaining\nagreement with TUMEC and its refusal to renegotiate. The mission also found\nthat there has been no salary increase for workers in five years.\n\n\n\nOver 60 per cent of the global supply of cobalt comes from DRC, which is one\nof the world\u2019s poorest countries. Swiss-based Glencore expects demand for the\nmetal, which is also a key component for smart phone batteries, to increase by\n67 per cent over the next three years. Cobalt prices have more than doubled in\nthe past year.\n\n\n\nAt the end of last year, the Drive Sustainability partnership, a group of the\nworld's leading car companies, including BMW, Volkswagen and Ford, launched a\nnew initiative to identify and address ethical, environmental, human, and\nlabour rights issues associated with the sourcing of raw materials.\nIndustriALL is calling on all car manufacturers to carry out due diligence in\nthe sourcing of cobalt for the industry.\n\n\n\nIndustriALL\u2019s general secretary, Valter Sanches, said:\n\n\n\n\u201cAuto companies need to live up to their customers\u2019 expectations that the\nelectric vehicles they sell are produced responsibly. Cobalt from Glencore,\nwhich is so critical for the batteries in those electric vehicles, is anything\nbut.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking them to not buy from Glencore, we\u2019re asking them to pressure\nGlencore to live up to Glencore\u2019s own claims to produce responsibly and to\nrespect workers\u2019 rights and the communities where it operates.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndustriALL has written to the Glencore CEO, Ivan Glasenberg, with a list of\ndemands to redress the situation of workers at its mines in DRC.\n\n\n\nGlencore employs about 15,000 people in DRC, through its subsidiaries Mutanda\nMining and Katanga Mining, which owns the Kamoto Copper Company.

According to a report by the consultancy Horizon Advisory, Xinjiang\u2019s\nrising solar energy technology sector is connected to a broad program of\nassigned labor in China, including methods that fit well-documented patterns\nof forced labor.\n\n\n\nMajor solar companies including GCL-Poly, East Hope Group, Daqo New Energy,\nXinte Energy and Jinko Solar are named in the report as bearing signs of using\nsome forced labor, according to Horizon Advisory, which specializes in\nChinese-language research...\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government disputes the presence of any forced labor in its supply\nchains, arguing that employment is voluntary. The companies named in the\nreport either did not respond to requests for comment or denied any role in\nforced labor.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, a representative for the Chinese Embassy in Washington called\nforced labor in Xinjiang \u201ca rumor created by a few anti-China media and\norganizations,\u201d adding that all workers in Xinjiang enter into contracts in\naccordance with Chinese labor law. \u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018forced labor,\u2019\u201d\nthe representative said...\n\n\n\nTogether, the solar companies named in the report supply more than a third of\nthe world\u2019s polysilicon, which is refined from rock and turned into the solar\npanels that end up on rooftops and utility energy projects, including those in\nthe United States and Europe.\n\n\n\nGCL-Poly, Daqo New Energy, Xinte Energy and East Hope Group did not respond to\nmultiple requests for comment.\n\n\n\nIan McCaleb, a spokesman for Jinko Solar, said the company \u201cstrongly condemns\nthe use of forced labor, and does not engage in it in its hiring practices or\nworkplace operations.\u201d He said that it had reviewed the claims in the Horizon\nreport and \u201cfound that they do not demonstrate forced labor in our\nfacilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe growing scrutiny of the region has already prompted changes among some\ncompanies whose supply chains are entangled in these programs...The solar\nsector could face similar pressure. The industry has deep ties to Xinjiang,\nwhich accounts for about 40 percent of global polysilicon production, said\nJenny Chase, the head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF...\n\n\n\nRoth Capital says 3 gigawatts of modules have been held; Disruption in trade\nmay slow renewables expansion in America\n\n\n\nCompanies say they fear the law that came into effect Tuesday aiming to\nprevent shipping of goods using forced labour is difficult and costly to\ncomply with\n\n\n\nRetailers highlighting issue of forced labor face backlash from Chinese\nconsumers\n\n\n\nKagome first major Japanese corporation to cut ties over Uyghur issue\n\n\n\nInvestors are putting pressure on Western companies over alleged human rights\nabuses in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, requesting more information about supply\nchains and urging companies to act to prevent abuse.\n\n\n\nChina National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC) says in a statement that\nsome foreign brands are suspected of violating human rights in China\u2019s\nXinjiang by excluding Xinjiang cotton and its products from their supply\nchains in the name of so-called supply chain compliance.\n\n\n\nThis report examines the extent to which the forced labour of Uyghurs and\nother ethnic minority groups in the Xinjiang is contributing to UK value\nchains.

The SEC's order finds that the\noffering materials created and distributed to investors by Credit Suisse hid\nthe underlying corruption and falsely disclosed that the proceeds would help\ndevelop Mozambique's tuna fishing industry. Credit Suisse failed to disclose\nthe full extent and nature of Mozambique's indebtedness and the risk of\ndefault arising from these transactions.\n\n\n\nThe SEC's order also finds that the scheme resulted from Credit Suisse's\ndeficient internal accounting controls, which failed to properly address\nsignificant and known risks concerning bribery.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to cross-border securities law violations, the SEC will\ncontinue to work collaboratively with overseas law enforcement and regulatory\nagencies to fulfill its Enforcement mission,\u201d said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director\nof the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \u201cOur action against Credit Suisse today\nis yet another example of our close and successful coordination with\ncounterparts in Europe and Asia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Credit Suisse provided investors with incomplete and misleading disclosures\ndespite being uniquely positioned to understand the full extent of\nMozambique's mounting debt and serious risk of default based on its prior\nlending arrangements,\" said Anita B. Bandy, Associate Director of the SEC's\nDivision of Enforcement. \"The massive offering fraud was also a consequence of\nthe bank's significant lapses in internal accounting controls and repeated\nfailure to respond to corruption risks.\"\n\n\n\nA London-based subsidiary of Russian bank VTB separately agreed to pay more\nthan $6 million to settle SEC charges related to its role in misleading\ninvestors in a second 2016 bond offering. According to the SEC's order, the\nsecond offering as structured by VTB Capital and Credit Suisse allowed\ninvestors to exchange their notes in an earlier bond offering for new\nsovereign bonds issued directly by the government of Mozambique. But the SEC\nfound that the offering materials distributed and marketed by Credit Suisse\nand VTB Capital failed to disclose the true nature of Mozambique's debt and\nthe high risk of default on the bonds. The offering materials further failed\nto disclose Credit Suisse's discovery that significant funds from the earlier\noffering had been diverted away from the intended use of proceeds that was\ndisclosed to investors. Mozambique later defaulted on the financings after the\nfull extent of \"secret debt\" was revealed.\n\n\n\nThe SEC's order against Credit Suisse finds that it violated antifraud\nprovisions as well as internal accounting controls and books and records\nprovisions of the federal securities laws. Credit Suisse agreed to pay\ndisgorgement and interest totaling more than $34 million and a penalty of $65\nmillion to the SEC. As part of coordinated resolutions, the U.S. Department of\nJustice imposed a $247 million criminal fine, with Credit Suisse paying, after\ncrediting, $175 million, and Credit Suisse also agreed to pay over $200\nmillion in a penalty as part of a settled action with the United Kingdom's\nFinancial Conduct Authority.\n\n\n\nVTB Capital consented to an SEC order finding that it violated negligence-\nbased antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting\nor denying the findings, VTB Capital agreed to pay over $2.4 million in\ndisgorgement and interest along with a $4 million penalty.\n\n\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Lesley B. Atkins and Douglas C.\nMcAllister with assistance from Wendy Kong of the Office of Investigative and\nMarket Analytics, Carlos Costa-Rodriguez of the Office of International\nAffairs, and supervisory trial counsel Tom Bednar. The case was supervised by\nMs. Bandy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of\nJustice's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and Fraud Section, the\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the United\nKingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory\nAuthority, and the United Arab Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED  \n1 Twitter 2 Facebook 3RSS 4YouTube  \n6LinkedIn 8 Email Updates\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) yesterday fined Hon Hai Precision Industry Co\n(\u9d3b\u6d77\u7cbe\u5bc6) NT$150,000 (US$5,010), saying that the iPhone assembler did not\ndisclose its plan to invest in Tsinghua Unigroup (\u7d2b\u5149\u96c6\u5718) as soon as the board\napproved the deal, the agency said.\n\n\n\nHon Hai said in a July 14 filing to the TWSE that its subsidiary Foxconn\nIndustrial Internet Co Ltd (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5eb7\u5de5\u696d\u4e92\u806f\u7db2) had invested 5.38 billion yuan (US$797\nmillion) in the state-backed Chinese chip company through several smaller\ninvestments in Chinese companies, a corporate data filing showed.\n\n\n\nTWSE-listed companies should not postpone disclosing such major investments,\nthe local bourse said.\n\n\n\nThe fine came after the Ministry of Economic Affairs\u2019 Investment Commission\nsaid that it might fine Hon Hai, as the company invested in the chipmaker\nbefore gaining regulatory approval in Taiwan, the Central News Agency\nreported.\n\n\n\nThe fine for such a regulatory lapse would be NT$50,000 to NT$25 million,\nministry data showed.\n\n\n\nThe ministry said it received the application from Hon Hai on Tuesday last\nweek and has requested the company submit additional documents, as the\ninformation provided was insufficient.\n\n\n\nThe ministry would determine whether Hon Hai\u2019s investment in the Chinese chip\ncompany involves component technologies for which additional rules apply, the\nreport said.\n\n\n\nIf it does, the investment would need to be scrutinized by a special\ncommittee, the ministry said.\n\n\n\nOil dropped the most in a week since April as the full weight of languishing\nChinese demand and more economic tightening radically shifted the market\u2019s\nsentiment.

If the IRS aimed to reclaim all the avoided taxes, it would be\nseeking a figure close to the largest tax repayment in US history\u2014behind\nGlaxoSmithKline\u2019s $3.4 billion settlement with the IRS in 2006.\n\n\n\nChinese tax authorities may also have questions about the arrangement, a\nChinese tax law expert said.\n\n\n\nWalmart\u2019s arrangement, internally named \u201cProject Flex,\u201d revolved around the\ncompany\u2019s payments to its Chinese subsidiary in Shenzhen, from which it\nsources many of the billions of dollars of Chinese goods it imports every\nyear, the former executive wrote in a presentation explaining it. To avoid\npaying tax in either the US or China, Walmart created a \u201ctax nowhere\u201d entity\nthat neither country would claim jurisdiction over, according to the former\nexecutive.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe goal of Project Flex was to create something from nothing, that China\nwould say is nothing, but which the US tax rules would be required to\nembrace,\u201d the former executive wrote in the presentation. Tax law experts\nconfirmed the executive\u2019s thesis that the structure does not exist in Chinese\nlaw and said the IRS would have grounds to challenge Walmart.\n\n\n\nWalmart rejected that assessment. \u201cThese issues were raised years ago,\nindependently and thoroughly investigated at the time and the tax year\ncovering the matter has been closed by the IRS,\u201d a company spokesman said in\nan emailed statement. \u201cThe IRS also has an on-site office at Walmart full-\ntime, year-round. Through our participation in the IRS Compliance Assurance\nProcess [CAP] program, we have open and transparent discussions, proactively\nshare information about corporate structures as they occur, including this\nmatter, and provide other materials the IRS requests.\u201d Walmart has been in the\nvoluntary CAP program since 2005.\n\n\n\nThe Walmart spokesman declined to comment on when the independent\ninvestigation took place and which law firm conducted it, whether the IRS was\naware of the structure\u2019s legal viability in China, and which tax year the IRS\nhas closed. Project Flex started in 2014, and would become unnecessary by 2017\nunder US tax law changes. Walmart avoided around $2 billion in tax through a\n\u201cdeemed dividend,\u201d obtained in 2014, and then dodged around $200 million per\nyear thereafter, the former executive argued. If the IRS closed the 2014 tax\nyear for Walmart, it\u2019s possible it wouldn\u2019t be able to go after the $2\nbillion. (EY, the accounting firm that helped Walmart devise the arrangement\naccording to the former executive\u2019s documents, declined to comment for this\nstory.)\n\n\n\nThe documents were shown to Quartz by a third party who had been sent the\ndocuments by the former Walmart **** executive. The former executive, who\ndeclined to comment on this story, citing a confidentiality agreement with\nWalmart, wrote the documents with a view to sending them to the IRS, which\ngives financial rewards to whistleblowers. It\u2019s unclear, however, if they were\never actually sent to the agency.\n\n\n\nThe former executive\u2019s files include the legal contract for the \u201ctax nowhere\u201d\nentity\u2014an ostensibly Chinese \u201cjoint venture\u201d\u2014and a lengthy slide deck and\ndetailed legal memo explaining why the IRS has a claim to the money, both\nwritten by the former executive. A person familiar with the arrangement\nconfirmed that the structure was set up as described in the documents. ****\nMuch of the structure can also be seen in internal Walmart files obtained in\nthe Paradise Papers leak, which the International Consortium of Investigative\nJournalists shared with Quartz.\n\n\n\nSome of the machinations are \u201cegregious,\u201d said Wei Cui, an expert in American\nand Chinese tax law and professor at the University of British Columbia, who\nreviewed the files for Quartz. \u201cThe idea is that they create an entity that\ndid nothing, completely a piece of paper,\u201d he said. \u201c[The] arrangement is\naggressive\u2014there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf the IRS took Walmart to court, it would have a good shot at recovering at\nleast some of the $2.6 billion, tax experts said. \u201cI think there is a good\nargument based on the facts presented by the whistleblower that the structure\nactually does not work [as a means of avoiding US tax],\u201d said Omri Marian, a\ntax-law professor at the University of California, Irvine. He added that he\ncouldn\u2019t be sure of the strength of any legal challenge, since the files don\u2019t\ninclude the legal opinion commissioned by Walmart, which, the former\nexecutive\u2019s memo says, argued the structure would hold up in court.\n\n\n\nWhile the structure might not stand up as a tax-avoidance mechanism, there\u2019s\nno allegation that Walmart broke US law, since tax avoidance on its own is not\nillegal. An IRS spokesperson declined to comment for this story, citing a\nfederal law that prohibits the agency from discussing specific taxpayers.\n\n\n\nWalmart, with annual revenue hitting $501 billion in 2018, has topped the\nFortune Global 500 every year since 2014. Its owners, the Waltons **,**\nreportedly the world\u2019s richest family, are said to add $100 million per day to\ntheir $191 billion fortune. A 2015 report by the Americans for Tax Fairness\ncampaign group alleged that Walmart had placed assets worth at least $76\nbillion in tax havens where it had no retail stores\u2014a figure equal to 37% of\nthe company\u2019s total assets at the time. (Walmart called the group\u2019s findings\n\u201cincomplete and erroneous.\u201d)\n\n\n\n\u201cOur old report showed there was an octopus. Its foreign subsidiaries\u2014and the\nsecretive nature of these foreign subsidiaries\u2014was remarkable and it appeared\nto be a substantial tax dodge,\u201d said Frank Clemente, Americans for Tax\nFairness\u2019s executive director and co-author of the 2015 report. Project Flex\n\u201cseems to me to be some smoking-gun evidence of the extent to which Walmart\nengaged in subterfuge and tax dodging.\u201d\n\n\n\nWalmart is far from alone in using offshore mechanisms to avoid tax. In total,\nUS multinationals held around $1 trillion offshore by the end of 2017, the\nFederal Reserve estimated, with giants such as Apple and Microsoft brazenly,\nand legally, booking profits in tax havens like Ireland.\n\n\n\nWalmart paid its Shenzhen subsidiary via a commission on the imported goods,\nsending the commission from the US parent company to a subsidiary in Hong\nKong, which then sent it on to another subsidiary in Shenzhen to pay for\nWalmart\u2019s 1,000-employee operation there, according to the documents.\n\n\n\nA second former Walmart employee, with direct knowledge of its taxes,\nconfirmed that Walmart held the Hong Kong subsidiary via this structure, which\ncan also be seen in an internal company slide from 2009, found in the Paradise\nPapers.\n\n\n\nWalmart paid a 1.4% commission on the pre-shipping cost of the goods to the\nShenzhen entity, but declared to US authorities that it was paying an amount\nworth 5% to a foreign subsidiary, according to the former executive\u2019s account.\nIt didn\u2019t have to pay US tax on that money, since it was just presumed to be\ngoing to another part of the same company. Walmart then kept the remaining\n3.6% in the Hong Kong subsidiary, the former executive\u2019s files say. This\namounted to stashing around $600 million per year in the Hong Kong subsidiary,\nwhich had \u201cno employees or activities,\u201d the former executive wrote.\n\n\n\nThe former Walmart tax employee summarized the goal for Quartz: \u201cThey wanted\nto park some profits in places where it wasn\u2019t subject to tax\u2014neither in\nChina, nor in the US.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the time, that was likely an acceptable tax-avoidance arrangement under US\nlaw, according to the documents. The Hong Kong arrangement had been in place\nsince 2001, according to the former executive\u2019s memo. Filings with Hong Kong\u2019s\ncorporate registry show the entity, WMGS Co. Ltd, was created that year.\n\n\n\nWhile sitting in Hong Kong, the money could amass millions of dollars in\ninterest without being taxed. Many US multinationals allow money to accrue\ninterest offshore and wait until a new presidential administration grants a\ntax holiday, allowing the companies to repatriate it at discounted rates. At\nleast some of the money was used to make loans to finance other Walmart\nentities, the person familiar with the arrangement said.\n\n\n\nTo avoid paying tax in Hong Kong, Walmart wasn\u2019t allowed to do substantive\nbusiness there, creating headaches even if it wanted to just hold meetings,\nthe former Walmart tax employee said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to go to the\nmainland\u2014they wanted to go to Hong Kong, it\u2019s easier to fly into,\u201d the person\nsaid. \u201cUnder the old structure, that would be discouraged because you\u2019d be\nbreaching a deal [with the Hong Kong authorities].\u201d\n\n\n\nIn November 2014, however, Walmart changed the structure of the arrangement.\nIt went through a highly complex 11-step process to create a \u201cjoint venture\u201d\nbetween Walmart\u2019s British Virgin Islands and Dutch subsidiaries, the former\nexecutive wrote. Under Project Flex, the \u201cjoint venture\u201d replaced the Hong\nKong subsidiary. The former executive\u2019s documents include a copy of the \u201cjoint\nventure\u201d agreement signed by Walmart\u2019s then-global head of tax and a vice\npresident in its Global Treasury department, who is also listed as a director\nof the Hong Kong subsidiary on the company\u2019s public filings.\n\n\n\nThis joint venture claimed to be Chinese. Its legal agreement includes just\none line saying it \u201cshall be governed by and construed in accordance with the\nlaws of China.\u201d Since the \u201cjoint venture\u201d was ostensibly based in China,\nWalmart was then able to claim a US tax credit on that annual $600 million in\nrevenue because US authorities would assume it was still being taxed on that\nmoney in China, the former executive wrote. It also didn\u2019t pay tax in China on\nthe \u201cjoint venture,\u201d according to the former executive\u2019s files.\n\n\n\nHowever, the type of joint venture created under Project Flex doesn\u2019t exist as\na valid entity in Chinese law, according to two Chinese tax law experts and\nthe former executive. \u201cThis is a fictitious joint venture,\u201d said Jinyan Li, a\nprofessor at York University in Toronto and expert on Chinese tax law. \u201cIt\nmakes me feel so mad when I see people taking these things seriously for tax\npurposes. This is really not a corporation, not any entity recognized by\nChinese law.\u201d Walmart said it had the structure investigated by an independent\nlaw firm.\n\n\n\nFurther, the former executive noted in the presentation, by marrying the BVI\nentity with the Dutch entity, Walmart was creating a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with\nitself. The BVI entity and its parent company, Wal-Mart Far East Holdings,\nalready owned the Dutch entity, the former executive said. Dutch public\nfilings confirm that structure, and show the firm was created the day before\nthe \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement was signed. \u201cWhat\u2019s a good reason for someone to\ndo something not by itself but with another entity created by itself? It\u2019s\nvery hard to say that there\u2019s any purpose for that [aside from tax\navoidance],\u201d said Cui. \u201cGiven what I\u2019ve seen, I can\u2019t think of any other\nreasons.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe person familiar with the arrangement said the \u201cjoint venture\u201d was created\nfor \u201cbusiness reasons.\u201d \u201cThe old structure was very restrictive on what\nactivities they could perform in Hong Kong,\u201d the person said, adding that the\ncompany wanted to hire more talent in Hong Kong and attend trade shows and\nengage in other business activity there. \u201cIt didn\u2019t necessarily require a\njoint venture, but the JV was the most efficient way to enable that without a\nbunch of ripple effects.\u201d The person said Walmart considered the argument\ndescribed by Cui and Li, and consulted with Chinese legal counsel when setting\nup the structure.\n\n\n\nThe US tax exemption that would have allowed Walmart to dodge payments on the\nmoney stashed in the JV exists because US authorities expect that when a\ncompany transfers money between two of its entities in a foreign country, that\ncash will have been taxed in that country. However, since the \u201cjoint venture\u201d\ndidn\u2019t really exist under Chinese law and Chinese authorities were likely not\neven aware of it, the former executive contended **** that Walmart owes around\n$200 million per year in US tax on the $600 million annually sent to the\nallegedly fictitious entity.\n\n\n\nThe person familiar with Project Flex said that Walmart \u201cwent through some\npretty significant negotiations and discussions with the IRS\u201d to support the\n5% commission figure, and that it disclosed the full structure to the agency.\n\n\n\nIf Project Flex continued until 2017, when changes to US tax law would have\ndented some of its avoidance strategies, the IRS would have grounds to sue\nWalmart for around $600 million based on the \u201cjoint venture,\u201d based on the\ncalculations in the former executive\u2019s presentation. The independent US tax\nexperts told Quartz they agreed. There could be a separate argument to sue for\nan extra $2 billion, the former executive argued.\n\n\n\nAllowing Walmart to use the \u201cjoint venture\u201d structure would make one element\nof the US tax code \u201cmeaningless,\u201d the former executive argued in the\npresentation. \u201cCompanies will be able to create \u2018same country\u2019 income anywhere\nin the world without the corresponding burden of having to form a local\ncountry entity that would be subject to local country taxes.\u201d\n\n\n\nBased on the former executive\u2019s presentation, the IRS would have a good case,\nMarian argued, adding that tax courts can impose extra penalties for what is\ndeemed to be aggressive avoidance, as well as demand repayment of $600 million\nplus interest. **** Extra penalties can be as high as 40% of the initial\namount of tax avoided.\n\n\n\nCui, who agreed the IRS would have a decent case, noted the agency would also\ntake on a \u201clitigation risk\u201d by bringing it to court. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of law\nin this area\u2014it would be hard to predict how a judge would rule on this very\ntechnical issue,\u201d he said, adding he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to the argument that a\ndecision in favor of Walmart would make it easy for other firms to abuse the\ntax exemption Walmart used.\n\n\n\nCui said the Chinese government also could\u2014and \u201cshould\u201d\u2014have taxed Walmart on\nthe money. However, Beijing likely tolerates the avoidance because it doesn\u2019t\nwant to lose business from big multinationals, he said. \u201cIf China decides to\ncrack down on Walmart, which is probably the last thing it wants to do now, it\nwould have to do that to a lot of others,\u201d he said. \u201cWalmart\u2019s Shenzhen\noperation is a big deal, so people are happy enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nLi disagrees, arguing that upon learning about the scheme, Chinese tax\nauthorities \u201cwould be interested\u2014they will probably give Walmart\u2019s\nrepresentative in China a call.\u201d The crux of the matter is whether Walmart has\npreviously told China 1.4% is the market rate for a commission for such\nservices\u2014and whether it has the data to persuade authorities that is the case,\nshe says.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a magic show, and the intended audience is the IRS,\u201d she said. \u201cThe\nChinese may look at it and say, \u2018Hey, this looks interesting. Is our interest\nhurt?\u2019 They may look and say, \u2018We\u2019re still happy with 1.4%.\u2019 They may not do\nanything; they may be offended that China is used as a prompt for this show\nput on for the IRS, but look at their interests and say, \u2018We remain happy with\n1.4%.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nBeyond $200 million in tax avoided per year, the company essentially paid\nitself a dividend of around $6 billion by shifting the scheme from the Hong\nKong shell company to the \u201cjoint venture,\u201d the former executive argues in the\npresentation, saying EY and Walmart had valued the arrangement at around that\nsum. That \u201cdeemed dividend\u201d should incur $2 billion more in taxes, the\nexecutive argued. Marian said he agrees that the transaction, as described by\nthe former executive, could be judged a \u201cdeemed dividend\u201d but can\u2019t be certain\nit would succeed in court without analyzing the counter-argument written by\nWalmart\u2019s lawyers. Cui said it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cslam dunk\u201d in court. If the IRS\nsigned off on the 2014 tax year, Walmart is probably safe from any legal\nchallenge over the $2 billion, since the \u201cdeemed dividend\u201d occurred when the\nstructure changed in 2014.\n\n\n\nEY has been Walmart\u2019s auditor since 1969, earning $24.5 million for its\nservices in fiscal year 2018 alone. In 2014, while EY\u2019s auditors independently\nanalyzed Walmart\u2019s accounts, its tax consultants advised it on how to\nstructure Project Flex, the former executive alleged, writing that they were\npaid \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d for the plan. Major accounting firms\nare facing a series of crises around the world, many of which are related to\nperceived conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, a US Senate investigation into manufacturing firm Caterpillar\u2019s taxes\nsaid that EY\u2019s rival PwC raised \u201csignificant conflict of interest concerns\u201d by\nacting as both an auditor and tax consultant to the firm\u2014just as EY did for\nWalmart. It recommended that the government\u2019s audit regulator, the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board, ban accountancy firms from fulfilling both\nroles for one company. The board reportedly opened an investigation into\nwhether the case represented a conflict for PwC. In the UK, where accountancy\nfirms are trying to avoid auditing scandal-plagued retailer Sports Direct,\nboth EY and Deloitte have insisted they are conflicted out, since they have\ndone non-audit work for the company or an entity it has bought.\n\n\n\nEY\u2019s tenure as Walmart\u2019s auditor last came under scrutiny in 2015, when a\nWalmart shareholder accused EY of knowing Walmart may have paid bribes in\nMexico a long time before the accountancy disclosed the matter to authorities.\nWalmart agreed to pay a $282 million settlement over the case earlier this\nyear. **** At the time, EY declined to comment on matters involving its\nclients.\n\n\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":1,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Credit: DaytonDailyNews\n\n\n\nMost of the counts brought by John Crawford III\u2019s parents against Walmart in a\ncivil lawsuit survived summary judgment and will proceed to trial, a federal\njudge ruled today.\n\n\n\nCrawford, 22, of Fairfield, was shot twice and killed Aug. 5 2014, by a\nBeavercreek police officer in that city\u2019s Walmart. The trial had been\nscheduled to begin next week, but Beavercreek appealed and the trial was\ndelayed until Oct. 28.\n\n\n\nCrawford was holding a Crosman MK-177 BB\/pellet rifle he found unpackaged on a\nstore shelf. A lone 911 caller, Ronald Ritchie, told dispatchers a black man\nwas holding a rifle, appeared to be loading it and waving it near people,\nincluding children.\n\n\n\n **RELATED:Beavercreek appeals ruling in deadly Walmart shooting**\n\n\n\nBeavercreek officer Sean Williams and Sgt. David Darkow responded to Walmart,\nand Williams fired twice within seconds of seeing Crawford after officers said\nthey shouted out commands. Crawford was on his cell phone talking to the\nmother of his two children.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice ruled that the wrongful death count\nagainst Walmart be dismissed. But the judge also ruled in a 38-page opinion\nfiled today that trial against Walmart will continue on claims of negligence,\npremises liability, survivorship and loss of consortium.\n\n\n\nCredit: DaytonDailyNews\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the court\u2019s view, based on the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could\nfind that Wal-Mart breached its duty to take reasonable precautions to protect\nits customers from foreseeable dangers,\u201d Rice wrote. \u201cAlthough Wal-Mart was\nnot required by law to secure the MK-177 pellet rifles, a reasonable jury\ncould find that it should have done so.\u201d\n\n\n\n **RELATED:Judge rules most of Crawford suit against Beavercreek can go to\ntrial**\n\n\n\nRice also found it reasonable that a jury could rule Walmart had a duty to\nreturn the item to its package and that Walmart took too much time to warn\nCrawford that carrying such an item was dangerous after four employees knew\nabout it.\n\n\n\nThe judge also ruled a reasonable jury could find negligence on Walmart\u2019s part\nbecause it knew the MK-177 could be confused with an AR-15 style firearm\nregardless of the warning on the box or Ohio\u2019s open-carry laws.\n\n\n\nRice noted that the MK-177 box, which was redesigned to take out staples and\nbe easy to open, includes a warning that states, \u201cDO NOT BRANDISH OR DISPLAY\nTHIS AIRGUN IN PUBLIC - IT MAY CONFUSE PEOPLE AND MAY BE A CRIME.

During the altercation, Williams threatened to call authorities if\nMangum did not leave the store.\n\n\n\nMangum, who works as a counselor for at-risk youth in the Portland area,\nrefused to leave.\n\n\n\nMangum's lawyer Greg Kafoury told NPR Walmart should use the verdict to assess\nits security practices and who is hired to carry out those duties.\n\n\n\n\"They don't have a role in their community. They don't care about the rights\nof their customers,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRandy Hargrove, Walmart's senior director for national media relations told\nNPR in a statement, that the company believes the verdict is \"excessive\" and\nis \"not supported by the evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\"We do not tolerate discrimination. We believe the verdict is excessive and is\nnot supported by the evidence,\" Randy Hargrove said.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Mangum was never stopped by Walmart's Asset Protection.

Our lawyers look\nat settlement compensation payouts in Walmart injury cases, what you can\nexpect if you have an accident claim against this retailer, and how to\nincrease the settlement amount you receive for your case.\n\n\n\nEveryone knows Walmart. It is the world's largest company by revenue in 2021\nand the largest non-governmental employer. It is the most frequently sued\nprivate personal injury claims defendant in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Owings Mills Maryland Walmart](photos\/walmart_store_1.jpg)Walmart gets sued\nnearly 20 times a day, close to 5,000 lawsuits each year. Many of these\nlawsuits have been brought by Walmart's employees, bringing employment\ndiscrimination and wage and hour claims, mostly involving overtime.\n\n\n\nOur law firm handles **only** serious injury and wrongful death personal\ninjury cases. This article is about personal injury tort claims against\nWalmart. Most typically, they are slip and fall or other premises liability\ncases, truck accidents, negligent security, or pharmacy malpractice cases.\n\n\n\nCan you sue Walmart if you are a customer and suffered an injury as the result\nof their negligence? Most likely, you can. How do you sue Walmart or convince\nthem to settle? You best best path is to hire the best lawyer that you can.\n\n\n\nWhy a Walmart specific page? Walmart is a big defendant. There are some\naspects about suing Walmart and fighting this company in court that are\ndifferent from dealing with other companies. It does not reflect any\nparticular animosity our lawyers have towards Walmart.\n\n\n\nA quick survey of our law firm shows almost all of our lawyers and paralegals\nshop there. You cannot avoid Walmart and Amazon in 2021. But it is the rare\nbig large company that is even-handed when it comes to claims and litigation.\nWalmart plays hardball from the incident report to appeal of your verdict.\n\n\n\nWalmart has a reputation in accident claims for being particularly aggressive.\nIn some ways, the company is like its shoppers. Walmart wants to get the best\ndeal that it can. But, in this case, Walmart getting the best deal means not\ngiving the victims that it hurts and kills by its negligence reasonable\ncompensation for the harm it causes. That is not justice.\n\n\n\nHow does Walmart handle claims against it? They fight them.\n\n\n\nHow does that work? Walmart has set up a subsidiary called Claims Management,\nInc. act as its own third-party insurance adjuster. Claims Management manages,\nvalues, and tracks Walmart accident claims. It does all of the legwork on\nprocessing claims, getting information from the victims, trying to get\nrecorded statements, and so forth.\n\n\n\nYou will feel like you are dealing with a separate company that might give you\nthe feeling that you are dealing with a third party who might treat you more\nfairly. Ultimately, you are dealing with Walmart.\n\n\n\nWalmart has good lawyers. Any big settlement with Walmart will have the\ntightest confidentiality clause you have ever seen. So Walmart keeps the\nlion's share of the settlement compensation payouts it makes under tight\nwraps.\n\n\n\n![Owings Mills Maryland Walmart](photos\/walmart_store_2.jpg)Generally\nspeaking, it is easier to fight against a large corporation than it is to\nfight an insurance company. Why? Because insurance companies often have in-\nhouse counsel -- paid attorney employees -- to challenge their claims.\n\n\n\nEven big companies need to hire lawyers. This makes settling claims before a\nlawsuit is filed more advantageous. Big companies often do not want to have\ntheir reputations besmirched by being the subject of many lawsuits. The\ncorporate image also acts as an incentive to settle cases more quickly.\n\n\n\nWalmart seemingly cares little about these things. It acts a lot like an\ninsurance company. It does not fear its reputation will be tarnished by\nlitigation (unless maybe someone really famous is involved). It is not\nparticularly concerned about legal fees.\n\n\n\nThe one way Walmart's policy in injury cases is different from an insurance\ncompany is that it fights harder. The company aggressively challenges personal\ninjury lawsuits even when it makes economic sense to settle the claim. This is\nprobably to discourage the filing of lawsuits. But it has not worked.\n\n\n\nBut win or lose, this retail giant desperately wants to make plaintiffs'\nlawyers feel like they have been in a fight. Getting documents from them in\nlitigation is always World War III. Walmart has been sanctioned by judges\naround the country for not producing documents and frustrating legitimate\nfact-finding by the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n\n\n\nCan Walmart be beaten in an accident claim? Absolutely. The deciding factor in\nmost lawsuits against Walmart or any other defendant in this country is the\nfacts. The side that should win usually does win.\n\n\n\nThat is the good news. The bad news that in the average settlement on a\nWalmart claim is that you are going to have to fight to get what you deserve.\nMost Walmart settlement offers will be for far less than fair value. Getting\nfairly compensated is likely going to require that you retain a personal\ninjury lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Owings Mills Maryland Walmart](photos\/walmart_store_3.jpg)Below are\nsummaries of some successful verdicts and settlements around the country. We\ndid not pull these at random, so please do not think these are a\nrepresentative sampling or that they can tell you by themselves the value of\nyour or your client's case, even if you have similar facts.\n\n\n\nWhere are the big Walmart settlements as opposed to verdicts?

Smucker Co., and retail giant Walmart were\nall accused in lawsuits of falsely advertising the number of servings in\nground coffee canisters, and therefore overcharging customers. A total of nine\nlawsuits were filed across California, Florida, Illinois, and Missouri about\nthe canister capacity.\n\n\n\nNow, just one case will be argued in a Missouri court, **Law360 reported**.\n\n\n\nThe move had to go through the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation,\nwhich agreed to consolidate five of the class action lawsuits and four\npossible tag-along lawsuits. All the cases carried similar claims of\nmisrepresentation, breach of warranty, unjust enrichment, and violation of\nstate consumer protection laws. Folgers, Smucker, and Walmart did not oppose\ncentralizing the case but insisted on Missouri over California as the venue.\n\n\n\nThe lead plaintiff behind the Florida class action, Marcia Sorin, **accused\nFolgers** of \u201cunlawful, unfair, and deceptive business practices\u201d because the\ncompany promises a certain number of cups of coffee can be brewed from a\npackage, when in reality \u201cthe can contents cannot produce anywhere near the\nnumber of cups represented,\u201d her class action lawsuit claims.\n\n\n\nSorin says that Folgers Classic Roast, which states on the front label that it\nmakes up to 380 six-ounce cups, only makes about 265 to 275 six-fluid-ounce\nservings \u2014 even when following the directions on the label.\n\n\n\nSorin\u2019s lawsuit alleges several other Folgers products\u2019 serving sizes don\u2019t\nadd up \u2014 including Folgers Special Roast Medium, Folgers \u00bd Caff Medium,\nFolgers Coffeehouse Blend Med-Dark, and Folgers Breakfast Blend Mild, which\nall claim to produce 210 six-ounce coffee servings while only producing about\n150 to 160 servings according to Sorin.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, **lead plaintiff in the Illinois lawsuit** Ellen Moser says she\npurchased a 30.5 oz. container of Folgers Classic Roast from Walmart, which is\nadvertised to make 240 cups of coffee, but was left disappointed when the\ncontainer made much less, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\n\nFolgers went on the defensive in November, according to Law360, and urged the\nFlorida courts to dismiss Sorin\u2019s proposed class action. The company\nchallenged the testing undertaken by Sorin\u2019s \u201cexpert chemist,\u201d and said a\nlabel suggestion did not equate to instructions on how to drink coffee.\n\n\n\n ** _Have you purchased Folgers coffee and feel you didn\u2019t get your money\u2019s\nworth?

Barclays Capital routed all its\ncustomers\u2019 marketable orders to LX, prior to routing to any competing venue,\nif the order could be filled in LX completely or partially at the National\nBest Bid and Offer or better, unless customers opted out of this routing\npreference.\n\n\n\nBarclays Capital failed to conduct reasonable reviews of execution quality for\nits customers\u2019 orders. The firm did not review price improvement data for\norders routed to LX. The firm also did not review speed of execution for any\nof the venues to which it routed customers\u2019 orders or consider whether the\nfirm could have obtained better execution speed from competing markets.\n\n\n\nBarclays Capital also failed to consider alternate routing arrangements even\nwhen the firm\u2019s own data showed that fill rates in LX were inferior to fill\nrates at some competing venues. Specifically, the reports reviewed by the\nfirm\u2019s Best Execution Working Group indicated that marketable orders routed to\nLX received lower fill rates as compared to certain competing venues. These\nreports showed that LX delivered a lower fill rate than the average fill rate\nof competing venues for every quarter from 2015 to the first quarter of 2019.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Barclays Capital\u2019s supervisory system was not reasonably designed\nto achieve compliance with its best execution obligations because the firm\nfailed to reasonably review for price improvement for orders routed to LX and\nspeed of execution for any venue. The firm\u2019s written supervisory procedures\nalso failed to provide reasonable guidance on the factors the firm should\nconsider in determining whether to modify its routing practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cFINRA continues to prioritize broker-dealers\u2019 compliance with best execution\nrequirements when handling their customers\u2019 orders,\u201d said Jessica Hopper,\nExecutive Vice President and Head of FINRA\u2019s Department of Enforcement. \u201cFirms\nmust continuously monitor their reviews of execution quality and make changes\naccordingly.\u201d\n\n\n\nFINRA Rule 5310\u2014Best Execution\u2014requires firms to seek the most favorable terms\nreasonably available for their customers\u2019 orders. To meet this obligation,\nfirms must conduct reviews to evaluate the order execution quality their\ncustomers receive under the firm\u2019s current routing arrangements, as well as\nthe execution quality their customer orders could receive through different\nrouting arrangements. Rule 5310 lists several factors that firms should\nconsider when conducting these reviews, including price improvement\nopportunities and speed of execution.\n\n\n\nFINRA included best execution as a topic in its 2022 and 2021 FINRA\nExamination and Risk Monitoring Program reports, as well as its 2020 and 2019\nAnnual Risk Monitoring and Examination Priorities letters.\n\n\n\nIn settling this matter, Barclays Capital consented to the entry of FINRA\u2019s\nfindings without admitting or denying them.\n\n\n\n **About FINRA**\n\n\n\nFINRA is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to investor protection and\nmarket integrity.

During meal breaks, Walmart required Associates to go\nthrough a lengthy \u201casset protection\u201d process that included an anti-theft metal\ndetector checkpoint if they wished to leave the warehouse at lunch. The\nprocess took so long that it would significantly cut into Associates\u2019\n30-minute lunch breaks, and Associates feared that they would have no time to\nclock back in upon returning from break. As a result, Associates at the\nwarehouse felt \u201clike criminals,\u201d and avoided leaving the premises for their\nbreaks. The California federal jury found that Walmart: (1) failed to provide\nmore than 1,900 employees with proper meal breaks, and (2) discouraged those\nemployees from enjoying those breaks outside of the building.\n\n\n\nCalifornia State law provides employees with a 30-minute meal break for every\n5 hours worked. Additionally, California employees must be allowed to take\ntheir meal break off-work premises and spend it however they see fit. If an\nemployer fails to provide an employee with a proper meal break, the employer\nshall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at an employee\u2019s regular\nrate of compensation. Employees who believe that they are not being provided\nproper meal breaks, or are subject to other workplace violations, should seek\nlegal counsel to analyze their potential legal claims.\n\n\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP focuses on complex civil litigation, including\nsecurities, antitrust, wage and hour, personal injury and consumer class\nactions as well as shareholder derivative and merger and transactional\nlitigation.

The\nshooting at the El Paso Walmart marks the fourth shooting of the deadliest 12\nacross America that took place in Texas.\n\n\n\nSix of the 12 deadliest shootings in the country have taken place in the past\nfive years, as the shootings at the Las Vegas music festival, Pulse nightclub,\nSutherland Springs church, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the San\nBernardino regional center, and now the Walmart in El Paso, have all occurred\nsince 2015.\n\n\n\nFour of the five worst gun massacres on the list -- including the deadliest,\nat a concert in Las Vegas -- occurred in the past two years.\n\n\n\nThe country \"has experienced an increase in mass casualty attacks\" wrought by\nmentally troubled individuals \"who commit mass murder in furtherance of some\nperceived grievance or ideological cause,\" John Cohen, a former\ncounterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security and a\nconsultant for ABC News, said after the massacre in Las Vegas, in which 58\npeople were killed.\n\n\n\nABC News has compiled a list of the 12 deadliest mass shootings, which\nincludes some incidents that had the same death tolls. Any suspects who were\nkilled in the incidents are not included in the death tolls.\n\n\n\nStephen Paddock, from Mesquite, Nevada, was identified by authorities as the\nshooter holed up in a Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino hotel suite, packing as\nmany as 19 guns. Around 10 p.m. he opened fire on thousands of country music\nconcert attendees across the street below, killing 58 people; more than 500\nothers were injured.\n\n\n\nAround 2 a.m. Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old former security guard, opened fire\nand killed 49 people who were in an Orlando gay nightclub called Pulse. During\nthe rampage, Mateen, a U.S. citizen, was killed by responding police in a\nshootout. His ISIS-inspired hate crime injured more than 50 other people. Law\nenforcement sources told ABC News that Omar Mateen's wife, Noor Mateen, had\ntried to dissuade him from committing the act. She was charged with aiding and\nabetting him, as well as committing obstruction. Noor Mateen has pleaded not\nguilty.\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech senior Seung-hui Cho, 23, purchased a 9-mm Glock handgun on\nMarch 13, 2007, and a .22-caliber gun within a week before he started shooting\npeople at the Blacksburg campus, including five professors and 26 fellow\nstudents. The South Korean\u2013born Cho began his rampage in a dorm room, where\ntwo students were shot and killed. According to police, he rearmed at his dorm\nroom and left a note before going out and killing 30 more people in four\nclassrooms, He then turned a gun on himself.\n\n\n\nAdam Lanza was 20 years old when he entered Sandy Hook Elementary School\nwearing a bulletproof vest and armed with a semiautomatic rifle and two\nsemiautomatic handguns \u2014 a Glock and a Sig Sauer. He breached the school by\nshooting out a window pane of the front office, then gunned down and killed 26\npeople, including 20 first-graders and six adult school staff members. Not\nincluded in the death count is Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, who police say was\nslain before he arrived at the school, as well as Adam Lanza, who took his own\nlife at the school.\n\n\n\nAt least 26 people were killed and 20 others were injured when a shooter\nopened fire at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. Further details\nof the shooting in the rural community, about 30 miles southeast of San\nAntonio, were not immediately clear.\n\n\n\nAfter slamming his Ford Ranger truck into the window of Luby's Cafeteria,\n35-year-old George Jo Hennard said, according to The Killeen Daily Herald,\n\"This is what the women of Bell County made me do.\" He then started firing his\nguns and murdered 23 people and left 20 more wounded. Ten of Hennard's victims\nwere killed by single shots to the head. Once police responded, Hennard\nretreated to a restroom, where he killed himself.\n\n\n\nThe suspect was identified by authorities as Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen,\nTexas, and he was \"taken into custody without incident\" and without any law\nenforcement officers firing their weapons, according to El Paso Police\nDepartment Sgt. Robert Gomez. He later told investigators he wanted to shoot\nas many Mexicans as possible, two law enforcement officials told ABC News.\n\n\n\nThe wounded ranged in age from a 2-year-old to an 82-year-old victim.\n\n\n\nThe officials also said an assault-style rifle, similar to an AK-47, was\nsecured at the scene along with several magazines.\n\n\n\nAt a news conference on Saturday night, El Paso police chief Greg Allen said\nthat 20 people had died and 26 more had been injured. Allen said authorities\nare examining what he called a \"manifesto\" they believe was written by the\nshooter and shows a possible \"nexus\" to a hate crime. Two people who had\nsuffered injuries later succumbed to those injuries while being treated at a\nhospital, bringing the total number of victims to 22.\n\n\n\nJames Oliver Huberty entered the fast food restaurant armed with a long-\nbarreled Uzi, a pump-action shotgun and a handgun and took the lives of 21\nadults and children and injured 19 others, including an elderly person and a\nbaby, according to The San Diego Tribune. An hour after the shootings, a\npolice sharpshooter killed Huberty, reported the Tribune.

The plaintiff Eugene\nDeMaso claimed that the product label was misleading because the cookies did\nnot contain fudge made from dairy fats or actual mint leaves. However, U.S.\nDistrict Judge Charles R. Norgle held that the label was not misleading\nbecause no consumer expects the fudge to be made with dairy fats, or that the\nmint refers to anything other than a flavor.\n\n\n\nDeMaso had alleged that fudge must contain dairy ingredients as its source of\nfat, but that the Walmart cookies contain only vegetable oils. DeMaso\u2019s\nallegation was largely based on his own definition of fudge. However, the\ndefinition of \u201cfudge\u201d was not at issue but what a reasonable consumer expects\nfudge to mean. Judge Norgle held that DeMaso did not plausibly allege that\nreasonable consumers would expect fudge to contain fat from dairy ingredients\nrather than vegetable fats.\n\n\n\nDeMaso also argued that the declaration of the word \u201cmint,\u201d pictures of mint\nleaves, and green packaging led consumers to believe the cookies contained\nmint as an ingredient. However, Walmart suggested that absent words such as\n\u201cmade with mint,\u201d a reasonable consumer would only conclude that the cookies\ntasted like mint. Agreeing with Walmart, the court found that mint is most\ncommonly associated with flavor, and that reasonable consumers would read the\nmint representation as a flavor and it would be unreasonable and fanciful to\nconclude otherwise.\n\n\n\nDeMaso sought to pursue his claims on behalf of a class of Illinois consumers,\nas well as consumers in 25 other states. The case was dismissed with\nprejudice.\n\n\n\nAbout this Author\n\n\n\nKeller and Heckman offers global food and drug services to its clients.

Dukes et al.\n- Opinion of the Court, Wal-Mart Female Employees Try Again for Sex-Bias Class\nAction, by Jordyn Holman **\n\n\n\nIn 2001, six female employees of Walmart filed suit against their company in\nUS federal court alleging that Walmart discriminated against them in salary,\nbonuses and training. After extensive discovery and oral argument, in 2003 the\nplaintiffs filed an amended complaint requesting that the court certify the\ncase as a class action on behalf of current and former female Walmart\nemployees maintaining that the discrimination faced by the original plaintiffs\nwas systematic in nature and affected all women employed by Walmart. In June\nof 2004, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. The\nlawsuit represents approximately 1.5 million current and former female Walmart\nemployees, which makes it the largest workplace bias case in US history.\nWalmart appealed the class certification decision.\n\n\n\nIn February of 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower\ncourt's ruling granting class action status to this gender discrimination\nlawsuit. In February 2009, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted\nWalmart's request for an en banc review of the lower court's ruling granting\nclass action status. This review was heard in late March 2009. In April 2010,\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that this lawsuit could move forward\nto trial as a class action lawsuit. Walmart petitioned the Supreme Court in\nAugust 2010 asking it to hear an appeal of the Ninth Circuit Court's ruling\nallowing this lawsuit to proceed as a class action. The company maintains that\nthe claims should be handled individually (or in smaller groups) rather than\nas a class of more than one million women. In December 2010 the Supreme Court\nannounced that it would hear Walmart's appeal in this case. The Court heard\noral arguments in late March 2011. The Court issued its ruling on 20 June 2011\nreversing the court of appeals ruling allowing the case profile as a class\naction. On 27 October 2011, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint with the\nfederal court in San Francisco, claiming gender bias on behalf of workers in\nCalifornia. On 16 January 2012, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the\nsuit, claiming the smaller proposed class action seeks to cover all women who\nwere employed at any Walmart in any region that included a California store.\nThis motion to dismiss was rejected by the court of appeals in September 2012.\nIn August 2013, however, the district court issued an order denying the women\nclass certification. If the women want to pursue the claims against Walmart,\nthey will have to each pursue their respective claims individually.\n\n\n\nIn June 2012, nearly 2,000 female Walmart employees filed discrimination\ncharges against the company with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission. In August 2013, the US federal court issued an order denying the\nwomen class certification. If the women want to pursue the claims against\nWalmart, each will have to pursue her claims individually.\n\n\n\nIn November 2017, seven women who were part of the 2001 suit filed a new\nlawsuit in Florida Southern District Court alleging gender discrimination in\ncompensation and promotion against Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club female employees in\nthree regions in the southeastern USA. The plaintiffs are asking for\ncompensation including back pay and damages for lost compensation and job\nbenefits. Walmart once again declared that these claims were not suited to\nqualify as class action.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case is ongoing.\n\n\n\n20 YEARS OF\n\n\n\nEvents | Jobs | Media | Data Usage & Cookies | Contact Us\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Business & Human Rights Resource Centre and its collaborative\npartners take no position on the diverse views presented in linked material\nwithin the database, nor can we guarantee the factual accuracy of all the\narticles and reports we make available.

I\u2019m way beyond that and for items never even received.\nThis has happened many times in the past where they never fulfil the order\nthen they wait 10days before cancelling it then another 10 days before\nrefunding.

Cousins filed an order partially\ngranting Walmart\u2019s motion to dismiss wage theft claims filed against it by\nPlaintiffs Salvador Guzman and James Marshall.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs, both Walmart employees, alleged that the retailer failed to\npay its workers wages for time spent undergoing COVID-19 related temperature\nchecks before work.\n\n\n\nThey also claimed they weren\u2019t paid their meal period premiums correctly and\nwere not provided accurate wage statements, which is in violation of state and\nfederal labor laws.\n\n\n\nHowever, the judge sided with Walmart on most of the claims, agreeing that the\nplaintiffs had not given sufficient evidence to stand up their allegations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWalmart argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 first three causes of action should be\ndismissed for failure to state a claim,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThe Court agrees\nbecause the three causes of action generally allege labor code violations\nwithout offering any specifics about Plaintiffs\u2019 experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe judge pointed to the allegations made by the plaintiffs that they were\nunderpaid their meal period premiums.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs do not identify a single date when either of them was paid a meal\nperiod premium at an incorrect rate,\u201d the judge stated. The workers also claim\nthey were not paid overtime correctly; however, the judge says no dates were\nnoted by the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\nJudge Cousins tossed allegations under **California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law**\n, finding the complaint fails to allege that Guzman and Marshall lack an\nadequate legal remedy.\n\n\n\nHe said Guzman and Marshall have until Feb. 14 to file an amended complaint.\n\n\n\nIn February last year, Walmart was **hit with another class action lawsuit**\nfrom employees who claimed the retail giant made them arrive at work at least\n30 minutes early for COVID-19 screenings that they weren\u2019t paid for.\n\n\n\n ** _Have you been asked to do COVID-19 screenings at work that you weren\u2019t\npaid for? Let us know your experience in the comments._**\n\n\n\nGuzman and Marshall are represented by Larry W. Lee and Mai Tulyathan of\nDiversity Law Group PC.\n\n\n\nThe **Walmart Temperature Check Class Action Lawsuit** is _Salvador Guzman et\nal. v. Walmart Inc. et al._ , Case No. 5:21-cv-09133, in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California.\n\n\n\n **Check out our list ofClass Action Lawsuits and Class Action Settlements you\nmay qualify to join!**\n\n\n\n **Read About More Class Action Lawsuits & Class Action Settlements:**\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\nAdd me please.

The motorcycles are CRF1100 Africa Twin,\nCBR1000RR-R Fireblade and GL1800 Gold Wing Tour. Honda has identified that\nthere is an issue with the PGM-FI unit or the fuel injection unit. Because of\nthis, the engine can stall while riding. However, there are no cases of any\nfailures reported in India.\n\n\n\nAlso Read : Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India's sales grow by 7% in August\n2022\n\n\n\nSo, BigWing dealerships of Honda will be flashing a software update to the\nmotorcycles that have been affected by the faulty fuel injection system. The\nprocedure should ideally take around 30 minutes to complete.\n\n\n\nThe dealerships will be contacting the customers through call, email or SMS\nfor an inspection of their motorcycle. Customers can also check if their\nmotorcycle is affected or not by entering their VIN or Vehicle Identification\nNumber on Honda BigWing's website.\n\n\n\nA total of 84 motorcycles have been affected that have been manufactured\nbetween 2020 to 2022. This will be a \u2018free of cost\u2019 procedure so it will be\ndone irrespective of the warranty status of the motorcycles. Honda will be\nstarting communicating with customers from 3rd September 2022.\n\n\n\nBesides this, Honda recently launched the CB300F in the Indian market. It sits\nbelow the CB300R.

BHP\u2019s South Flank expansion puts 86\nAboriginal sites at risk of damage or destruction.\n\n\n\nThe revelations by the Guardian came following a huge backlash against Rio\nTinto after its expansion in the Pilbara region destroyed a 46,000-year-old\nindigenous heritage site.\n\n\n\nSection 17 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 forbids damaging or destroying\nAboriginal heritage sites. Section 18 provides a get out of jail card to\nflouting Section 17 \u2013 securing consent from the government under Section 18\nessentially gives carte blanche to proceed as one pleases without fear of\nrepercussions under the Act.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Rio Tinto incident, Western Australia\u2019s Minister for Indigenous\nAffairs Ben Wyatt said on Twitter it was \u201ca terrible outcome\u201d and \u201cthe result\nof out of date legislation that doesn\u2019t acknowledge the value of heritage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThree days after Rio Tinto\u2019s destruction of the Juukan Gorge heritage site,\nWyatt approved BHP\u2019s South Flank expansion.\n\n\n\nWyatt\u2019s approval of the expansion has been widely condemned \u2013 the project puts\nup to 86 Aboriginal heritage sites at risk of destruction. But the traditional\nowners, the Banjima people, have no means to formally object to the approval\nand no means to prevent the sacred sites from being damaged.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite the public outcry when Rio Tinto blew up Juukan Gorge three weeks\nago, Ben Wyatt has continued to grant permits,\u201d Birkbeck, University of London\narchaeologist and anthropologist Lawrence Owens said. \u201cIndeed, in the three\nyears that he has been in power, he has not refused to grant a single Section\n18 application for a mining lease that was put before him.\u201d\n\n\n\nSection 18 approvals are irrevocable, and there are no allowances for new\ndiscoveries or developments. So the indigenous groups who hold these sites in\nsuch regard for their cultural and historical importance go unheard. There\nare, however, appeals processes if a mining company\u2019s Section 18 application\nis rejected.\n\n\n\nBHP quickly pledged that it would not damage the heritage sites that it\nreceived ministerial permission to destroy without \u201cfurther extensive\nconsultation\u201d with traditional owners, the Guardian reported. Previously, the\ntraditional owners had been legally prevented from speaking out about the\nsites.\n\n\n\nBHP has proposed several compromises, including recovering and storing\nartefacts at its Mulla Heritage Office. The company also offered to \u201cdigitally\ncapture the extent and form of each stone arrangement\u201d with a view to create\nthree-dimensional computer models and videos of the sites. The Banjima people\nhave not been willing to accept these proposals.\n\n\n\nOwens explains: \u201cBHP seem perplexed that their offer to relocate some sites or\ncreate electronic facsimiles of them away from the mining area have not been\naccepted by the Banjima, yet these sites are not comparable to Lascaux caves \u2013\nwhich was reproduced elsewhere for visitors \u2013 or Abu Simbel, which was moved\nto a new site ahead of the Aswan Dam development. To remove these sites is to\nclip out nodes on a vast network of significant places, and thus make them\nmeaningless; it is comparable to preserving a piece of clothing by cutting out\nthe patterns and leaving the rest.\u201d\n\n\n\nRio Tinto executives are holding meetings this week after being called in to\nexplain the company\u2019s destruction of Juukan Gorge to major shareholders. The\nwidespread backlash to that incident prompted renewed discussions of the\nlegislative protections of Aboriginal sites and the rights of Australia\u2019s\nindigenous population.\n\n\n\nAustralasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility executive officer Brynn\nO\u2019Brien told the Guardian that Rio Tinto executives had been \u201csurprised\u201d by\nthe backlash against the company, because it had acted in accordance with\nWestern Australian laws and longstanding industry practice. According to\nO\u2019Brien, investors had been concerned about BHP\u2019s track record with Aboriginal\nheritage even before news broke that it had received permission to expand\nSouth Flank.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndustries are designed to make money, at whatever cost. Cultural heritage is\nnot in their remit,\u201d said Owens. \u201cSo political restrictions exist to ensure\nthey do not get too powerful, thus social welfare and cultural heritage do not\nsuffer. Yet it is clear that in the WA case, the impotence of the laws issued\nby the latter have favoured the former to a ludicrous degree.\u201d\n\n\n\nWyatt has consistently provided the defence that updated Aboriginal\nprotections that do away with Section 18 entirely are on their way. With\nJuukan Gorge, and now BHP\u2019s expansion plans that risk 86 heritage sites, one\nmight hypothesise that mining companies, in conjunction with WA\u2019s mining-\nfriendly government, are fast-forwarding these processes before the door\ncloses entirely.\n\n\n\nOwens continued: \u201cThere is little about human history that cannot be recovered\nfrom archaeological research, but if you destroy something, that\u2019s it. There\nis no way back. In a thousand years from now \u2013 which is a blink of time for\nthe Aboriginal story \u2013 the descendants of modern Aboriginals will be able to\nshow their children a massive hole in the ground where their heritage used to\nbe. And all the iron dug out at such great cost will be rust.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere simply has to be a way to balance the cost of the future with the value\nof the past.\u201d\n\n\n\nMining news and in-depth feature articles on the latest mining company deals\nand projects covering trends in mineral exploration with up to date data on\nthe most mined metal and mineral commodities\n\n\n\nPowered by ![Pharma Tech Logo](\/code\/wp-content\/themes\/goodlife-\nwp-B2B\/assets\/images\/verdict-logo-w.png)\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Verdict Media Limited 2022\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\nEnergy transition will fail unless wind power issues...\n\n\n\nReNu Energy inks multiple green hydrogen agreements...\n\n\n\nCoal miner goes renewable\n\n\n\nPo Valley begins work at Podere Maiar gas field\n\n\n\nSantos completes fraccing at Innamincka\n\n\n\nVictorian election debate raises fraccing questions...\n\n\n\nRenergen redoes its raise\n\n\n\nENB Briefs: Valaris; Equinor; Houthi rebels; API data...\n\n\n\nVictorian election debate raises fraccing questions...\n\n\n\nGlobal LNG supplies are sold out for years, says top...\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs lowers its oil price forecast\n\n\n\nWarrego self-nominee to BOD pulls out post Beach TO...\n\n\n\nDeputy Editor: Energy & Commodities\n\n\n\nDigital capital raising platform opens doors with over 100 ASX offers\ncompleted\n\n\n\nPodcast Series: Agility in Oil & Gas and why it's needed now more than ever\n\n\n\nScott Macmillan, Invictus Energy, discusses their maiden drilling program\n\n\n\nMcDermott pivotal in global energy shift towards technology and\ndecarbonisation\n\n\n\nDigital capital raising platform opens doors with over 100 ASX offers\ncompleted\n\n\n\nPodcast Series: Agility in Oil & Gas and why it's needed now more than ever\n\n\n\nScott Macmillan, Invictus Energy, discusses their maiden drilling program\n\n\n\nMcDermott pivotal in global energy shift towards technology and\ndecarbonisation\n\n\n\nDigital capital raising platform opens doors with over 100 ASX offers\ncompleted\n\n\n\nPodcast Series: Agility in Oil & Gas and why it's needed now more than ever\n\n\n\nScott Macmillan, Invictus Energy, discusses their maiden drilling program\n\n\n\nMcDermott pivotal in global energy shift towards technology and\ndecarbonisation\n\n\n\nNew NOPSEMA CEO named\n\n\n\nBlack Mountain director resigns\n\n\n\nBlack Mountain replaces director\n\n\n\nPinsent Masons appoints energy partner\n\n\n\nStaff shake up at Viva\n\n\n\nPossibility of serious injuries or even death\n\n\n\nRegulator slaps Woodside with improvement notice\n\n\n\nBHP wants to leave Griffin subsea infrascture in place\n\n\n\nJadestone oil spill proof of \"significant\" threat to environment: NOPSEMA\n\n\n\nWorker injury at Woodside Vincent facility\n\n\n\nPinsent Masons appoints energy partner\n\n\n\nCannon-Brookes gets his way ahead of AGL AGM\n\n\n\nTwo special resolutions fail at 14D AGM\n\n\n\nBlack Mountain replaces director\n\n\n\nNew NOPSEMA CEO named\n\n\n\nBlack Mountain director resigns\n\n\n\nBlack Mountain replaces director\n\n\n\nPinsent Masons appoints energy partner\n\n\n\nStaff shake up at Viva\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000-2022 Aspermont Ltd.

According to\nIgor D\u00edaz, Sintracarb\u00f3n president, the decision was made without consulting\nthe union and is in violation of Colombian law.\n\n\n\n\"We are continuing the strike as the company has taken a firm position to\nremove benefits that are historically included in our collective agreement,\nand also wants to implement a shift system that will affect workers\u2019 health,\"\n\n\n\nhe said.\n\n\n\nThe new shift system \u2013 which workers call the \u201cdeath shift\u201d - will require\nworkers to work an additional 72 days per year with no wage increase. Workers\nwill move directly from day to night shifts without recovery time in a seven\nday cycle, with no transport home between shifts. It will disrupt family life,\ngenerate greater exhaustion and, as a result, increase workplace accidents.\n\n\n\nThe company argues that the shift change is necessary to make the mine\nfinancially sustainable, and is not subject to negotiation. According to\nSintracarb\u00f3n, the company is trying to reduce benefits in the collective\nagreement to finance the cost of compensating the workers who will be\ndismissed as a result of the introduction of the new shift.\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Labour summoned the parties to open dialogue to resolve the\nconflict, but Cerrej\u00f3n did not respond.

assault allegations at WA mine sites in Senate spotlight\n\n\n\nFor the latest flood and weather warnings, search on **ABC Emergency**\n\n\n\nSince late 2019, four separate allegations of sexual assault have been\nreported by BHP employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nSome of them are now before the courts.\n\n\n\nBut in one case, a perpetrator could not be identified and the alleged female\nsurvivor continues to work for the company.\n\n\n\nAnother alleged attack was reported at a Newcrest mine site in 2020, and as\nrecently as April there was an alleged incident at Fortescue Metals.\n\n\n\nRio Tinto has also conceded it has had instances of sexual assault and\nharassment, but has not said when.\n\n\n\nMinerals Council chief executive Tania Constable has condemned the attacks as\n\"shocking\".\n\n\n\n\"It's unacceptable, it's illegal and we don't want to see that at all in the\nmining industry,\" she said.\n\n\n\nMs Constable is due to appear before the federal Senate's Education and\nEmployment Legislation Committee tomorrow, where the allegations will be\nexamined as part of the committee's inquiry into the Sex Discrimination Act\n(Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021.\n\n\n\nThe bill aims to enact legislative changes borne out of Sex Discrimination\nCommissioner Kate Jenkins' 2020 Respect at Work report.\n\n\n\nThe report found the overall rate of sexual harassment in the Australian\nmining industry was 40 per cent, 11 per cent higher than the average across\nall industries.\n\n\n\nBut when the statistics were split along gender lines, the survey revealed\nwomen working in the mining sector were twice as likely to be sexually\nharassed as their male colleagues (74 per cent compared to 32 per cent).\n\n\n\nMs Constable said in the wake of the report, the mining industry established a\ncode of conduct to prevent sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n\"We want to see a number of things occur \u2014 that the culture is changing, the\nprevention measures and response measures are put in place, and practical\nthings like assessing a mine site, making sure that it's appropriate for\ngendered use \u2014 that people feel secure in being able to go to work and then go\nback to their accommodation,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe Perth Magistrates Court has heard a woman in her 20s, who was allegedly\nraped by a 35-year-old male colleague on a BHP site in November 2020, was\npassed out from alcohol at the time.\n\n\n\nHe was granted bail of $10, 000 and has been sacked by BHP.\n\n\n\nMs Constable said several of the miners recently reduced alcohol limits on\nsite.\n\n\n\n\"The industry as a whole is again taking a step back and saying, 'Well, you\nknow what \u2014 what place does alcohol have on a mine site?' and making sure that\nwe have something that is much more rigorous and much more uniform across the\nindustry,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"At this stage it is four standard drinks a day, and many companies are\nfollowing that guideline.\"\n\n\n\nFrom last Monday, Rio Tinto introduced a four-drink daily alcohol limit and\nsaid only mid-strength beer and cider would be available for purchase.\n\n\n\nWine sales were now limited to a maximum of two 187ml bottles per person per\nday.\n\n\n\nAt BHP, a daily alcohol limit of four standard drinks per day was introduced\non July 1.\n\n\n\nNewcrest would not reveal if it had an alcohol limit.\n\n\n\nFMG employees must undergo daily alcohol screening but are allowed up to six\nalcoholic drinks a day.\n\n\n\nWA Labor Senator Louise Pratt, who is on the Education and Employment\nLegislation Committee, pointed out that Ms Jenkins' report found alcohol was\noften a contributing factor in workplace sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n\"I think it is concerning if there is a generalised acceptance of high levels\nof drinking [on Australian mine sites],\" she said.\n\n\n\nShe said she had invited the chief executives of several mining companies to\nthe committee hearings but also hoped to hear from survivors.\n\n\n\n\"It's difficult for victims themselves to be able to tell their stories and I\nwould really encourage anyone who has experiences that they would like the\ncommittee to know about, to let us know,\" Senator Pratt said.\n\n\n\nWest Australian Liberal MP Libby Mettam has successfully pushed for a state\nparliamentary inquiry into the issue and hopes the allegations can be met with\nreal change.\n\n\n\n\"I believe there is an opportunity for this industry to be better \u2026 so that\nwomen feel comfortable working in these workplaces \u2026 and also men who\noverwhelmingly do not support any kind of harassment,\" she said.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, BHP asset president of West Australian iron ore Brandon Craig\nsaid sexual assault was \"completely unacceptable\" and had \"no place\" at BHP.\n\n\n\n\"In recent years we have brought on more security personnel, patrols and\nsafety escorts, improved lighting, signage and pathways, upgraded door locks\nand chains, and increased CCTV coverage,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We have plans in place for a further $300 million in upgrades to camp rooms\nand improved security measures.\"\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in a statement Newcrest said sexual assault was \"completely\nunacceptable\".\n\n\n\n\"Employees are actively encouraged to report any concerns directly to\nmanagement, or if they are uncomfortable in doing so are supported to raise\nconcerns through our independent and confidential Speak Out service,\" the\nstatement said.\n\n\n\nFMG CEO Elizabeth Gaines said the company had a \"zero tolerance\" approach to\nharassment.\n\n\n\n\"Harassment of any kind is considered serious misconduct and may be grounds\nfor dismissal,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRio Tinto iron ore chief executive Simon Trott said the company had a\nresponsibility \"to run villages that are safe, respectful and inclusive places\nfor all of our people, all of the time\".\n\n\n\n\"We have sought feedback from our workforce and carefully considered how we\ncan improve the experience of living at our villages, promoting respectful\nbehaviour, and safe and comfortable places to live and work,\"

Home to the\ncontinent's largest open-pit coal mine, the social movements behind the call\nargue that mineral revenues have failed to trickle down. La Guajira's Cerrej\u00f3n\nmine, which is co-owned by London-listed Xstrata, BHP Billiton and Anglo\nAmerican, has exported 500 million tonnes of coal since 1976. During that\nperiod however, La Guajira has remained one of Colombia's poorest states. Two\nof three (67%) of those living in the north eastern state remain in poverty.\n\"The mine has ended agriculture and industry, and removed the jobs these\nactivities created\", says Felipe Ustate Perez, president of Fecodemigua, a\nnon-profit representing communities displaced by mining.\n\n\n\n**Weak government institutions** : the mining industry points the finger at\nlocal authorities for sluggish development. \"Cerrej\u00f3n is the largest and most\nsolid entity in La Guajira\", says Juan Carlos Restrepo, the firm's vice\npresident of public affairs and communications. The company currently\nrepresents around 60% of La Guajira's gross domestic product, he adds: \"For\nbetter or worse, we are the company that people look at for their protests or\nto get their problems solved.\" Restrepo blames poor state governance for the\nregion's on-going problems. The mine's critics agree that levels of state\nadministration are poor, but argue that the kind of aggressive capitalist\neconomics symbolised by the likes of Cerrej\u00f3n lies behind the problem. \"The\nneo-capitalist system has privatized all the public systems \u2013 water,\nelectricity, gas \u2013 leaving the state with no resources to act\", says Ustate\nPerez of Fecodemigua.\n\n\n\n**Royalties redirected** : exacerbating social tensions in La Guajira is a\nrecent change in Colombia's mining law. Cerrej\u00f3n claims to have paid more than\n$3.9bn in taxes and royalties between 2001 and 2011. While tax revenues have\nalways gone to the central government, local municipalities used to collect\n60% of mining royalties (a total of $336m in 2011, in the case of Cerrej\u00f3n).\nUnder new rules, local municipalities now only receive 20% of the royalty\ncheque. The rest they have to bid for from central pot. The mining ministry\nargues that the revised system will increase accountability in public\nspending, and improve project planning and delivery. President Juan Manuel\nSantos has an aggressive plan to use Colombia's resource wealth as a driver\nfor national economic development. While the mining industry welcomes this,\nCerrej\u00f3n's Restrepo admits that the policy's legitimacy will rest on\ndelivering tangible benefits at a local level as well. \"In the national\ncontext, mining is under question \u2013 just as it is in the rest of the world\",\nhe says.\n\n\n\n**Community struggles** : in the rural communities surrounding Cerrej\u00f3n's\noperations, life remains tough. Around 67% of the La Guajira population live\nin poverty, with 37% classified as 'indigent'. Among the most marginalised are\nthe region's indigenous Way\u00fau people. This group depends on animal husbandry\nand small-scale agriculture for their livelihood. Following a bad rainy season\nearlier this year, many Way\u00fau communities are experiencing severe water\nshortages. \"Here we have so many needs, especially water. We have just one\nwell, but it operates manually which takes a lot of strength and when it dries\nup we must rely on neighbouring villages\", says Maria Valasquez, a 48 year-old\nWay\u00fau woman from Julujushimana, a village bordering Cerrej\u00f3n's railway. The\nnearby village of Santa Ana has a solar-powered water pump, paid for by the\ncompany. \"We want the same here\", she says. \"And we'd like the company to\nbuild us a road to the highway too.\"\n\n\n\n**Corporate social investment** : Cerrej\u00f3n has invested $19m in social\nprogrammes over the last two years. Most of its community investment projects\nare orientated through four separate foundations, which are run at arms-length\nfrom the company. Their activities focus on what Cerrej\u00f3n identifies as\npriority areas where it can have influence: water, economic progress,\nindigenous issues and institutional strengthening. The latter supports efforts\nby municipal authorities to pitch for development finance from the new central\nroyalties' fund, among other activities. Restrepo admits that Cerrej\u00f3n's\nsocial investment budget falls far short of what's needed to resolve La\nGuajira's development problems. As a result, the company targets the\ncommunities in its \"sphere of influence\" with interventions that are \"as\neffective as possible\". Even so, Cerrej\u00f3n's corporate responsibility efforts\nremain a drop in the ocean: \"Even though we spend a lot in the community, it\nwill take one hundred or one thousand [times] this money and people to change\nthe lives of these communities\", Restrepo says.\n\n\n\n**This content is brought to you by** **Guardian Professional** **.

She\nalso pushed the company to respond in writing.\n\n\n\nMark Bristow, chief executive officer of Barrick, said he would follow up with\na written response to Ms. Hoffman. He also fielded a question from Sophie\nSwope, a resident of the city of Bethel, whose residents similarly depend on\nthe Kuskokwim River.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a very fertile and sponge-like land of tundra, which is one that will\nsoak up everything we leave behind,\u201c Ms. Swope said. \u201cIs there any chance we\nwill be able to continuously subsist on the salmon smelt and river water\nwithout facing any environmental health issues?\u201d\n\n\n\nIn response, Mr. Bristow said that Barrick is committed to managing the\nenvironmental impact of Donlin: \u201cHave no doubt that you will be able to\ncontinue your traditional activities, including fishing for salmon, once we\nmake the decision and develop the mine.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarrick will continue to engage with Indigenous groups in Alaska, Mr. Bristow\nsaid, adding that a trip is planned in November to meet with local\nstakeholders.\n\n\n\nThe potential development of Donlin is being discussed not long after another\nCanadian mining company with plans for a major new mine in Alaska suffered a\nserious setback. In 2020, the Donald Trump administration refused to grant\nVancouver-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. a federal mining permit to\nbuild the Pebble copper gold mine. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)\nconcluded that its proposed project in the Bristol Bay region of southwestern\nAlaska posed too big of a threat to the aquatic ecosystem, including the\nsockeye salmon population.\n\n\n\nHowever, unlike Pebble, the Donlin project received federal permits from the\nUSACE in 2018, making it more likely to go ahead. A bigger potential roadblock\nfor both Barrick and Novagold in moving forward is the astronomical price tag.\nThe capital costs of Donlin were last estimated at US$9.1-billion, close to\ndouble those of Pebble. Remoteness, the relatively low-grade nature of gold in\nthe ground, and a lack of infrastructure are some of the reasons why the costs\nare so high. Barrick hasn\u2019t yet decided whether it will build Donlin, and it\nis a few years out before even having to make that decision, with extensive\ndrilling and engineering work still to be carried out.\n\n\n\nBarrick already has a major new mine project in its near-term pipeline, which\nanalysts have said potentially makes it less likely to pull the trigger on\nDonlin any time soon. Last month the Toronto miner said it is planning on\nreviving the stalled Reko Diq copper gold mine in southwestern Pakistan. That\nproject has a estimated cost of US$7-billion, with Barrick contributing 50 per\ncent and Pakistan the rest.\n\n\n\n _Your time is valuable.

The Department of Justice declined to comment after U.S. office hours\non Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAustralian police confirmed they had been working with foreign counterparts\nand local regulators on Australian aspects of the U.S. investigation, without\nproviding further details.\n\n\n\nBHP said it had been cooperating with \u201crelevant authorities\u201d, and in response\nto media queries said it believed it had complied with all applicable laws in\nregards to its Olympics sponsorship.\n\n\n\n\u201cBHP Billiton is fully committed to operating with integrity and the Group\u2019s\npolicies specifically prohibit engaging in bribery in all its forms,\u201d BHP said\nin an emailed statement.\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest mining company has been under investigation for possible\ncorrupt practices since at least 2009, disclosing in 2010 that it had\nuncovered possible violations of some anti-corruption laws.\n\n\n\nBHP said on Wednesday it could not comment on whether that investigation had\nbeen expanded or whether the probe referred to on Wednesday was separate.\n\n\n\nFairfax reported that between 2000 and 2008, BHP spent millions of dollars on\na major Olympics sponsorship deal and hospitality package which according to a\nformer China staffer involved more than 170 VIPs, including senior government\nofficials and Chinese steel and mineral company CEOs.\n\n\n\nUnlike most major consumer-focused sponsors, BHP\u2019s involvement at the 2008\nBeijing Olympics was targeted mostly at its close circle of Chinese buyers and\nemployees.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost sponsorships focus on media buys and advertising. We\u2019ve done almost\nnone,\u201d Maria McCarthy, the head of BHP\u2019s Olympic sponsorship team, told\nReuters in March 2008.\n\n\n\n\u201cInstead, we are focusing on community leveraging, stakeholder leveraging that\ninvolves governments and customers, and our staff,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nA former BHP employee involved in the Olympics arrangements told Reuters BHP\nwent out of its way to comply with Australian rules and compiled extensive\ndocumentation on its activities.\n\n\n\nFairfax Media said the officials BHP entertained included the head of state-\nowned Chinese aluminium producer Chinalco and the secretary-general of the\nChina Iron and Steel Association, which coordinates industrial policy for\nChina\u2019s steel sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe long-standing enforcement practice of the US DoJ (Department of Justice)\nand SEC has been to treat executives of SOEs as government officials for\npurposes of the anti-bribery provisions,\u201d said Nathan Bush, an attorney\nspecializing in anti-corruption regulations with O\u2019Melveny & Myers LLP in\nBeijing.\n\n\n\nAn employee from China\u2019s flagship steelmaker, Baosteel, said BHP held a\nroundtable for its iron ore clients during the Olympic Games, where they\ndiscussed the outlook for the steel industry. He said lower-ranking employees\nattended.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was all part of their sponsorship, there was nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d\nhe said, adding that BHP gave participants Olympics T-shirts and tickets from\nits sponsorship package.\n\n\n\nAt the time, BHP was championing market pricing for iron ore instead of annual\ncontracts, drawing an angry response from Chinese steel mills forced to pay\nmuch more for raw materials.\n\n\n\nBHP was not one of the 12 sponsors in the International Olympic Committee\u2019s\nelite \u201cTOP\u201d programme - companies such as Coca Cola, Adidas, McDonalds and\nJohnson & Johnson who paid for the right to market themselves worldwide as\npartners.\n\n\n\nThe miner was instead a local sponsor, as it had been for the 2000 Games in\nSydney, paying Beijing organisers an undisclosed amount of money and providing\nmaterials for the 6,000 or so medals required for the Olympics and\nParalympics.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, after receiving questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission, BHP said it had discovered possible violations of anti-corruption\nlaws mainly related to some exploration projects that it had already\nterminated at the time.\n\n\n\nIt said then that the SEC\u2019s requests for information did not relate to any\nactivity in China or any of BHP\u2019s sales and marketing activities.\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Rob Taylor in Canberra and Nick Mulvenney in Sydney;\nEditing by John Mair and Richard Pullin\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Before he was able to\nget back on board, the train moved away with 268 wagons in tow and travelled\n92 km before it was deliberately derailed by BHP.\n\n\n\nCalculations by Reuters News service indicate that the train reached speeds of\nabout between 100 and 200 kilometres per hour before it was finally halted at\na location about 120 km from BHP\u2019s Port Hedland Mine operations.\n\n\n\nNo-one else was travelling on the train at the time of the incident and there\nwere no reported injuries.\n\n\n\nPrices in the spot seaborne iron ore market rebounded back over the US$75 per\ntonne level overnight due to the derailment.\n\n\n\nWestern Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is an integrated system of four processing\nhubs and five mines, connected by more than 1,000 km of rail infrastructure\nand port facilities in the Pilbara region of northern Western Australia.\n\n\n\nAt each mining hub \u2013 Newman, Yandi, Mining Area C, and Jimblebar \u2013 ore from\nmines is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended to create high-\ngrade hematite lump and fine products. Iron ore products are then transported\nalong the Port Hedland-Newman Rail Line to the Finucane Island and Nelson\nPoint port facilities at Port Hedland.\n\n\n\nThe Mount Newman railway line is one of Australia\u2019s longest private railway\nlines.\n\n\n\nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is sending officers to the\nPilbara to investigate after the runaway train, loaded with ore from BHP\u2019s\nNewman Mine site, suffered significant damage in the derailment.\n\n\n\nThe incident occurred at around 4:40 a.m. on November 5, 2018, the ATSB report\nsaid.\n\n\n\nNews of the forced derailment has put the spotlight on the WAIO reserve base\nwhich is relatively concentrated, allowing development to be planned around\nintegrated mining hubs, which are connected to the mines and satellite\norebodies by conveyor or spur lines.\n\n\n\nThis approach enables the value of the installed infrastructure to be\nmaximized by using the same processing plant and rail infrastructure for a\nnumber of orebodies.\n\n\n\nThere are four main WAIO joint ventures: Mt.

I feel uncomfortable,\nand then I look toward the chimneys,\" said Manon Lessard-B\u00e9langer, who lives\ntwo kilometres south of the Horne Smelter.\n\n\n\nConcerns about air and soil pollution from the smelter date back many years.\nFor more than two decades, adults and children have been tested to check their\nexposure levels to lead and arsenic.\n\n\n\nBut because the tests are so intrusive, until 2018, public health officials\nhad not been regularly asking for blood, urine or fingernail samples,\naccording to Dr. Omobola Sobanjo, a medical consultant with the Abitibi-\nT\u00e9miscamingue public health authority.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, however, they took fingernail samples from about half the\nneighbourhood's children between the ages of nine months and six years.\n\n\n\nThey found nine of the 34 children tested had concentrations of arsenic of 800\nto 4,400 nanograms per gram.\n\n\n\nThe average for all the children tested was 3.7 times higher than normal. As a\nbasis of comparison, public health authorities also tested children in the\nnearby town of Amos. Those children had an average arsenic presence of 110\nnanograms per gram.\n\n\n\nResearcher Daniel Proulx said children's health is a good indicator of the\noverall health of a population.\n\n\n\n\"Children are the most vulnerable to effects of lead and arsenic when it comes\nto the development of their nervous system,\" said Proulx, who led the study.\n\n\n\n\"When things are good with children, with the different contaminants, you can\ngenerally presume the rest of the population is also well.\"\n\n\n\nScientific literature shows that exposure to high levels of arsenic can cause\nsymptoms ranging from hair loss to liver damage and cancer, while exposure to\nlead can lead to brain damage.\n\n\n\nSobanjo said the levels of pollutants found in the air and soil near the\nsmelter, however, are not nearly high enough to signal lead and arsenic\npoisoning.\n\n\n\nStill, she said, \"As a public health doctor, I'm concerned that 50 per cent of\nmy population, of the children in that neighbourhood, are exposed.\"\n\n\n\nResidents who attended the meeting were given a pamphlet with tips on how to\nlimit their exposure to contaminants.\n\n\n\nThose tips include keeping windows closed on windy days, avoiding wearing\noutdoor shoes indoors and keeping children out of the room while vacuuming.\n\n\n\nThe Horne smelter is one of the world's largest producers of copper and other\nprecious metals, and it is North America's biggest recycler of electronic\ncomponents.\n\n\n\nGlencore, which bought the smelter in 2013, plans to invest $54 million by\n2021 to reduce all emissions, according to spokesperson Pierre-Philippe\nDupont.\n\n\n\n\"We've added many domes so we can manipulate the products inside a closed\nenvironment, instead of outdoors,\" said Dupont.\n\n\n\nThe company has also invested in technology to capture emissions before they\nare released.\n\n\n\nCarrie-Lynn Plante, whose two children attend daycare and school near the\nsmelter, said she had concerns going into the meeting. But she said overall,\nshe is relieved to see the company is taking measures to reduce emissions.\n\n\n\n\"I'm confident that it's a wake-up call. It took so long for them to act, and\nnow we're going to be seeing major action,\" said Plante.\n\n\n\n\"And if we don't, then they'll have to answer to us.\"\n\n\n\nEven after Glencore's investments to reduce pollution, arsenic emission levels\nwill be capped at a level that is 10 times higher than what provincial\nauthorities had demanded in 2004.\n\n\n\nAt that time, the province gave the smelter's previous owner, Xstrata, 18\nmonths to get its emission levels to 10 nanograms per cubic metre.\n\n\n\nBut over the years, the ministry raised that cap to 200 nanograms per cubic\nmetre.\n\n\n\nThe 2004 demand \"was based on the levels of reference for arsenic in the air,\nand not on what it was technically possible to do,\" said Annie Cassista, a\nmining expert with Quebec's Environment Ministry.\n\n\n\nBy 2021, the cap will be set at 100 nanograms per cubic metre. By comparison,\nthe concentration of arsenic across Quebec normally hovers around 1 to 2\nnanograms per cubic metre.\n\n\n\nCassista said the ministry does not have any plans to address the accumulation\nof arsenic or lead emissions in Rouyn-Noranda and further away.\n\n\n\nA federal database of pollutants shows the Horne Smelter has released 936,000\nkilograms (or 936 tonnes) of arsenic into the air since 1993.

In return, it assuages the global hunger for\ncoal \u2013 in Germany, too \u2013 by producing 30 million tonnes of it per year.\n\n\n\nEl Cerrejon is the biggest open-cast coal mine in Latin America, and one of\nthe biggest in the world. It is owned by the Swiss company Glencore. If\nGermany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has his way, \u201cThe Monster\u201d will play a\nlarge part in ensuring that Germans don\u2019t have to freeze next winter. The\nchancellor spoke to his Colombian counterpart, Ivan Duque, about it in early\nApril \u2013 because if Germany is to end its reliance on Russian coal, it must\nurgently find an alternative. A classic win-win situation, you might think.\nNot, however, for people like Dulcy Cotes. \u201cThe transnational companies are\nsuffocating us with their greed for profit,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n **Visit from an armed gang**\n\n\n\nCotes is one of the almost 700,000 indigenous Wayuu people, who live in\nVenezuela and north-eastern Colombia. More than 500 years ago, they were among\nthe first groups to be persecuted by the European conquistadors. Half a\nmillennium later, they were among the first victims of the illegal armed drugs\ncartels, who murdered them, extorted money, and drove them out. Now history is\nrepeating itself for the Wayuu for the third time. Many live close to the\nblack gold of El Cerrejon, meaning that they are once again in danger.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of our indigenous leaders, who is campaigning to stop the mining company\ndiverting the Bruno stream in order to extract more coal, was visited a month\nago by armed men on motorbikes. It\u2019s typical for attempts at intimidation to\nbe made against anyone who advocates on behalf of the environment and human\nrights,\u201d says Dulcy Cotes.\n\n\n\nShe, too, has experienced this hostility. As a prominent member of the\norganization Fuerza de Mujeres Wayuu [Force of Wayuu Women], which is doing\neverything in its power to resist the effects of the mining, she is often\ntargeted. \u201cMany communities have already had to move away,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause\nthe mine ate its way closer and closer to them. We don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n\n\n\n **Mining gives people an income \u2013 and makes them ill**\n\n\n\nBut there are divisions within the Wayuu community. On one side there are\npeople like Cotes, who are up in arms about the mine. On the other, there are\nthose who work in El Cerrejon, and badly need the money. The mine employs\nthousands of people, in a region where there are almost no other jobs and\nevery second person lives in poverty.\n\n\n\nBut Dulcy Cotes describes the back-breaking work they are made to do in the\nmine. \u201cThe people who are employed there work 12 hours at a stretch: the early\nshift from 6am till 6pm, or the night shift from 6pm to 6am They get sick from\nthis, and from all the coal dust. It\u2019s maximum exploitation. If they fall ill\nand demand compensation, they have to sue for it; the company never pays of\nits own accord.\u201d\n\n\n\n **What Germany needs to know about El Cerrejon**\n\n\n\nThere is a lot the human rights lawyer Rosa Maria Mateus Parra could tell\nGerman Chancellor Scholz about El Cerrej\u00f3n. It is not a pleasant story. Its\ngrim chapters bear titles like: exploitation, expropriation, forced\nresettlement, expulsion, destruction, irreparable environmental damage.\nFurthermore, in recent years the childhood mortality rate has risen sharply.\nAround 5,000 Wayuu children have died of starvation and thirst in the region\naround the mine. This horrifying figure even prompted the Inter-American\nCommission on Human Rights to get involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s caused by the shortage of water, because rivers and streams are\ncontaminated, or have dried up,\u201d Mateus Parra explains. \u201cAnd the lack of food,\nbecause coal is now mined where indigenous communities grew their vegetables.\nThose children who survive have skin rashes and respiratory diseases because\nof the fine particle pollution. We\u2019ve proved all of this in court.\u201d\n\n\n\n **Last hope: a new president**\n\n\n\nWhat about the Colombian government? Mateus Parra is dismissive. She does,\nhowever, have high hopes of Gustavo Petro, whom she is backing to win the\npresidential election on May 29. Petro, a guerrilla in his youth, is an\neconomist and former mayor of the capital, Bogota. Mateus Parra says he is the\nonly candidate who is critical of the destructive exploitation of nature,\nwhereas the others are promoting continuity: the export of coal as a way to\nbring the domestic economic crisis under control.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provincial government of La Guajira is among the most corrupt in the\ncountry. And what we see coming out of Bogota is a political line that, in\nrelation to economic and business interests, is one thing above all:\nsubservient! No one examines it too closely when a company like Cerrejon Coal\nboasts that it is protecting fauna and flora and implementing reforestation,\neven though the reality is completely different.\u201d\n\n\n\n **Incomparable to German mines**\n\n\n\nStefan Ofteringer works in Colombia for Misereor, the aid organization of the\nCatholic Church in Germany, as a consultant for human rights. He has seen \u201cThe\nMonster\u201d with his own eyes. A few years ago, he walked along the edge of the\nmine in the blazing heat of La Guajira. He says he will never forget it. \u201cOn\nthe one hand, there is this massive destruction. Then there is the huge\nquantity of fine particle pollution, both from mining and from the\ntransportation of coal. And the earth tremors, and the noise from the daily\nblasting. Germany\u2019s Garzweiler mine [an open-cast lignite mine, one of the\nbiggest in the country \u2013 Editor\u2019s note] is child\u2019s play in comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nMisereor is one of 160 organizations from 30 countries that initiated the\ncampaign \u201cLife Not Coal\u201d earlier this month. They called on Scholz and Duque\nto stop exploiting the coal in El Cerrejon sooner rather than later, and,\nuntil then, to insist that human rights and environmental standards finally be\nupheld. \u201cDiverting the course of the nearby stream, which is what the mine\noperators are pushing for in order to extract more coal, would be a socio-\necological disaster,\u201d says Ofteringer.\n\n\n\n **Does the supply chain law pass the reality check?**\n\n\n\nOfteringer is pinning his hopes on the supply chain law passed by the German\nparliament last year. According to this law, German companies are also obliged\nto trace and remedy any deficiencies when importing coal from Colombia. Energy\ncompanies such as Steag and EnBW are therefore subject to this requirement.\nUniper and RWE also buy coal from Colombia.\n\n\n\nSo if all goes well, it\u2019s possible that \u201cThe Monster\u201d may become less\nfrightening in the future. The mine is expected to remain in operation until\n2034. However, human rights consultant Ofteringer warns that \u201cup until now,\nthe companies have never set standards that were fair to the local population.\nAnd it has always been the wealthy elites that have benefited from mining in\nColombia, never the impoverished population.\u201d\n\n\n\nBACK TO TOP![](https:\/\/frontline.thehindu.com\/theme\/images\/fl-online\/back-to-\ntop-arrow.svg)\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Use Google to translate the web site.

According to\nIgor D\u00edaz, Sintracarb\u00f3n president, the decision was made without consulting\nthe union and is in violation of Colombian law.\n\n\n\n\"We are continuing the strike as the company has taken a firm position to\nremove benefits that are historically included in our collective agreement,\nand also wants to implement a shift system that will affect workers\u2019 health,\"\n\n\n\nhe said.\n\n\n\nThe new shift system \u2013 which workers call the \u201cdeath shift\u201d - will require\nworkers to work an additional 72 days per year with no wage increase. Workers\nwill move directly from day to night shifts without recovery time in a seven\nday cycle, with no transport home between shifts. It will disrupt family life,\ngenerate greater exhaustion and, as a result, increase workplace accidents.\n\n\n\nThe company argues that the shift change is necessary to make the mine\nfinancially sustainable, and is not subject to negotiation. According to\nSintracarb\u00f3n, the company is trying to reduce benefits in the collective\nagreement to finance the cost of compensating the workers who will be\ndismissed as a result of the introduction of the new shift.\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Labour summoned the parties to open dialogue to resolve the\nconflict, but Cerrej\u00f3n did not respond. The union is willing to engage in\ntripartite dialogue, but Cerrej\u00f3n does not want the government to intervene.\n\n\n\nDuring its meeting on 25 September, the Glencore global union network\nexpressed solidarity with members of Sintracarb\u00f3n and called on Glencore to\nurge Cerrej\u00f3n to return to the negotiating table and seek a solution that\nbenefits workers, the community, the company and the country.\n\n\n\nIndustriALL assistant general secretary Kemal \u00d6zkan says:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that Cerrej\u00f3n uses workers to reduce costs, demanding that\nthey make huge concessions that will worsen their working conditions,\nincluding the inhuman shift change. The IndustriALL global union family\nsupports the strike for justice, equality and dignity. Sintracarb\u00f3n can count\non our support to ensure justice is done in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the workers\u2019 demands, Cerrej\u00f3n must return to the\nnegotiation table to find solutions in everyone\u2019s interest.

Glencore has confirmed the project\u2019s existence but said it moved to shut\nit down last month to \u201censure alignment\u201d with its recent decision to limit\ncoal production for environmental reasons.\n\n\n\nThe campaign aimed to engage key politicians, both to gauge their views on\ncoal and attempt to convince them of its continuing value.\n\n\n\nIntelligence was collected about key coal detractors, including Greenpeace and\n350.org, detailing their budgets, social media reach, and issues that could be\nused to embarrass or undermine them.\n\n\n\nA sophisticated digital campaign was mounted to help shift public sentiment\ntowards coal, using messaging informed by research, focus groups and polling\nconducted in multiple countries.\n\n\n\nCampaign teams helped set up online grassroots groups to push positive\nmessaging about clean coal technology, attack renewables and criticise the\nAustralian Labor party. The practice is commonly known as astroturfing.\n\n\n\nOne source with knowledge of Project Caesar said it was linked to Energy in\nAustralia, a Facebook group and website that attacks renewables, while\nsupporting high efficiency, low emissions (Hele) coal plants through data,\nmemes, graphics and video.\n\n\n\nPosts blame renewables for blackouts in South Australia and Victoria, link\nrenewable subsidies to \u201cSaudi billionaires\u201d, and stress a link between solar,\nwind and rising power prices.

Guardian Australia has found no evidence to\nsuggest the Australian Power Project is part of Project Caesar.\n\n\n\nProject Caesar also had a significant traditional media component, seeking to\namplify and spread pro-coal voices and messaging in mainstream media sources.\n\n\n\nThe project had an overarching strategy of shifting the emotion and tone of\nthe energy debate to favour coal by using arguments that were personally\nrelevant to its target audience. Its messaging was centred on themes of cost,\nreliability and family security.\n\n\n\nThe campaign contrasts with Glencore\u2019s more recent statement that it would cap\nglobal coal output, in part due to investor pressure to act on climate change.\n\n\n\nIt also potentially contrasted with the aims of another C|T Group client, the\nLiberal party, whose then leader Malcolm Turnbull was attempting to forge\nahead with new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees, which would\nhave reduced Australia\u2019s reliance on coal.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Glencore confirmed it had engaged the C|T Group on the\nproject, which it said used research, focus groups, and polling to \u201cbetter\nunderstand public views on coal\u201d.\n\n\n\nGlencore also confirmed it deployed a \u201cproactive communications campaign\u201d\ndesigned to counter the efforts of environmental activists.\n\n\n\nIt said the campaign complied with all relevant laws \u2013 Guardian Australia is\nnot suggesting otherwise.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe project also mandated CT Group to conduct a proactive communication\ncampaign on coal in compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory\nrequirements,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe project\u2019s objective was to convey simple facts about coal and in\nparticular to counter misinformation from environmental activists.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOur business continues to engage with a range of stakeholders on the role\nthat coal plays in socio-economic development and enabling access to reliable\nenergy. We also acknowledge the need to transition to a low carbon economy.\nGlencore\u2019s portfolio of commodities will allow the company to play a key role\nin this transition.\u201d\n\n\n\nGlencore said it told C|T Group to wrap up the project in mid-February to\nalign with its announcement on climate change and the decision to cap coal\noutput.\n\n\n\nThe C|T Group declined to comment, other than to say:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll information about our clients is treated with the strictest confidence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe revelations shed new light on the C|T Group\u2019s inner workings. Crosby, one\nof its founders, was knighted by the former UK prime minister, David Cameron,\nand has run the UK Conservative party\u2019s last four general election campaigns.\n\n\n\nThe strategies employed for Glencore in Project Caesar appear strikingly\nsimilar to those offered in a pitch for a \u00a35.5m campaign designed to cancel\nthe 2022 Qatar football World Cup.\n\n\n\nThe World Cup project, dubbed Project Ball, proposed setting up full-time war\nrooms across the world, lobbying friendly politicians, academics and\njournalists, and pushing messaging on social media and astroturfing sites.\nProject Ball was pitched to a Qatari opposition figure living in London in an\nattempt to delegitimise the Qatari government and pressure Fifa to \u201crestart\nthe bidding process\u201d for the World Cup hosting rights.\n\n\n\nProject Caesar took place as Glencore made other aggressive plays to protect\nits Australian interests.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Glencore mounted a surveillance operation targeting CFMEU members who\nwere picketing its Oaky North mine in central Queensland. Its \u201cclandestine and\nquasi-military activity\u201d was described as \u201cappalling\u201d by Australia\u2019s\nindustrial relations umpire, the Fair Work Commission.\n\n\n\nGlencore employed private investigators to secretly surveil union members\nusing long-lens cameras and video. A map of the homes of key CFMEU members in\nthe nearby town of Tieri was drawn up. Operatives took notes about their\nmovements, reporting back to Glencore on a 24-hour basis.\n\n\n\n\u201cNil Glencore staff members at the piquet [sic] lines in the past 24hrs,\u201d one\nbriefing note obtained by Guardian Australia read.\n\n\n\n\u201cApproximately 30 vehicles located at CFMEU guide hall 0800 hours this\nmorning.\u201d\n\n\n\nGlencore also launched an operation codenamed Project Zuckerberg to find\nevidence of potential social media policy breaches in discussions in private\nFacebook groups used by CFMEU officials at Oaky North.\n\n\n\nDocuments and images seen by Guardian Australia show Glencore also asked a\ncontractor to enter the lodgings of Oaky North workers when they called in\nsick. Photos of their empty beds were taken to help build evidence against the\nworkers.\n\n\n\nGuardian Australia has not found evidence to suggest the actions taken against\nthe CFMEU Oaky North members were linked to Project Caesar.\n\n\n\nGlencore\u2019s actions in Africa have also come under close scrutiny in recent\nyears.\n\n\n\nThe Paradise Papers, a leaked cache of millions of documents, showed how the\ncommodities giant acted to further its mining interests in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo.\n\n\n\nThe company engaged the mining magnate and Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler to\nnegotiate with the DRC government in 2009, giving him a $45m loan in pledged\nshares repayable if agreement was not reached within three months.

Since the Canadian mining giant assumed operational control of the mine\nfrom its subsidiary Acacia Mining in September 2019, violence by police in\nmine-related security operations has led to 32 recorded shootings, incidents\nof torture and other assaults, resulting in six deaths.\n\n\n\nBreaking these cases down, RAID\u2019s latest research, conducted between April and\nOctober 2022, has documented two people killed and 18 injured since the start\nof 2022 alone. This is in addition to four people killed and eight more\nseriously injured by police in the preceding two years, all but one of which\nRAID previously reported on.\n\n\n\nThese latest incidents bring the reported death toll at the North Mara mine to\nat least 77 and 304 wounded by police responsible for mine security, most of\nwhich occurred after Barrick acquired the mine in 2006. The rising number of\nkillings and assaults ranks Barrick\u2019s North Mara mine as one of the deadliest\nindustrial mines in Africa in terms of security-related violence.\n\n\n\n\u201cBarrick Gold may promote grandiose ESG claims about its operations at the\nNorth Mara mine, but the appalling death toll of Indigenous residents speaks\nfor itself,\u201d said Anneke Van Woudenberg, Executive Director, corporate\nwatchdog, RAID. \u201cBarrick Gold cannot hide from the stark fact that it is\noperating one of the deadliest mines in Africa. Without an end to the abuses\nand justice for those harmed, shareholders and pension funds invested in\nBarrick should think twice about whether this is a company they can continue\nto support.\u201d\n\n\n\nLeaders of the surrounding Kurya villages, whose people have long engaged in\nfarming, cattle-herding and artisanal mining in the area, say the mine has\ntaken their land and increasingly encroached on their way of life. Leaders and\nresidents interviewed by RAID said that the mine\u2019s arrival has led to Kurya\ncommunity members being treated as \u201cinvaders\u201d, targeted and criminalised.\n\n\n\nRAID sought Barrick\u2019s response to reports of the latest incidents. On 14 July\n2022, Barrick stated that \u201cwe do not tolerate human rights violations\u201d and\nthat these were \u201cextremely serious allegations\u201d warranting \u201ca thorough\ninvestigation conducted with the utmost care and meticulousness\u201d. It further\nstated that it would respond to the allegations once its investigation was\ncompleted. To date, no further information has been received from Barrick.\n\n\n\nCommunity members say the violence against them has increased over the past 12\nmonths. They say \u201cmine police\u201d (a term used by local residents to refer to\npolice the mine engages to provide security) regularly conduct mine-related\noperations in residential areas, force their way into homes without a warrant,\narbitrarily arrest and beat residents, and fire teargas and ammunition\nindiscriminately, including near children.\n\n\n\nIn what may be a new tactic, RAID also found that these police tortured Kurya\nresidents in mine-related operations to, among other things, extract\nconfessions that they had trespassed onto the mine or been involved in theft\nfrom the mine, or force them to identify others allegedly involved in such\nactivities. In at least two instances, RAID found indications that mine\npersonnel may have been aware of the torture.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_1_scrubbed_0.png?itok=dPzT6olt)\n_Artisanal mining, Nyabichune village, near the waste rock pile of Nyabirama\npit at the North Mara mine \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nIn one case in or around August 2022, Mwita (not his real name) was detained\nby \u201cmine police\u201d after they shot him in both legs with teargas cannisters from\nclose range as he was leaving a local village centre. The police took him to\nan area by the mine wall where he was positioned in front of one of the mine\u2019s\nCCTV cameras, which are monitored by the mine\u2019s control room. The police\ncompelled him to look directly at the camera, which swivelled to face him.\nMwita heard the police communicating over their radio, asking if they had\napprehended the right person. The voice over the radio, which Mwita understood\nwas from the person watching the CCTV camera, said no, but told the police to\nask Mwita the whereabouts of the people they were looking for. Mwita told the\npolice he did not know.\n\n\n\nThe police took Mwita to a mine vehicle stationed below the CCTV camera, where\nhis hands were fastened behind his back and he was affixed to a rod, faced\ndownward and repeatedly beaten with a club. During the beating, Mwita again\nheard the voice over the radio, asking the police if Mwita had told them\nanything yet. The police replied that he had not, and the beating resumed.\nWhen he was eventually released, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk properly\u201d due to\nthe pain and injuries he had incurred, but he was forced to make his own way\nhome. Before releasing him, the police told him to tell others what had\nhappened to him, so they would be aware of the consequences if they tried to\nenter the mine.\n\n\n\nIn another case in or around April 2022, John (not his real name) was arrested\nin a local shopping area and accused of being involved in theft from the mine.\nAlthough the \u201cmine police\u201d searched his home, they found nothing, and returned\nhim to the police station. At the station, he was ordered to confess to going\nto the mine, or they would \u201ccrucify\u201d him. John said that they repeatedly\ntortured him, including by suspending him from a rod and beating him with\nbatons.\n\n\n\nThose interviewed by RAID in recent months describe a growing climate of fear,\nand said that speaking out about the violence and other human rights abuses\nlinked to the mine was understood to be dangerous. In a public meeting\nconvened in or around April of this year, a senior police representative told\nthose gathered, in the presence of mine officials, that \u201canybody who goes to\nthe mine will be shot\u201d.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_2_scrubbed.png?itok=Xxd6dUCX)\n_Daily life continues along the mine road separating the North Mara mine wall\nfrom homes in Nyabikondo village, near the site of one of the recent shootings\n\u00a92022 RAID_\n\n\n\nThe intensification of violence coincides with the expansion of the mine\u2019s\nconcession area and Barrick\u2019s replacement of the mine\u2019s internal security team\nwith a new security provider, Nguvu Moja, in late 2020. Barrick removed\nweapons, including \u201csoft options\u201d, from Nguvu Moja guards which, according to\nformer mine security personnel interviewed by RAID, would mean an expanded\nrole for the police in the mine\u2019s security operations, and thus an increase in\nviolence. According to local leaders, Barrick\u2019s extensive use of the police,\nrather than private security, seeks to minimise the company\u2019s legal liability\nfor violence against local residents.\n\n\n\nThe North Mara mine pays, equips, feeds and houses on an ongoing basis roughly\n150 police officers, who operate under a signed agreement between the company\nand police. They are armed with rifles, submachine guns, batons and wooden\nclubs, as well as teargas and sound bombs that they fire from launchers. In\ncorrespondence with RAID, Barrick says that the mine does not employ,\n\u201csupervise, direct or control\u201d police assigned to it, and is not responsible\nfor their conduct, and that references to \u201cmine police\u201d are \u201cfactually\nincorrect\u201d.\n\n\n\nBut members of the mine\u2019s internal security team and police officers\ninterviewed by RAID say the police assigned to the mine form part of the\nmine\u2019s security structure. They say the police are deployed to specific areas\naround the mine site, that they are present in the mine\u2019s security control\nroom, and that they use the same radio frequency as the mine\u2019s internal\nsecurity team. A senior police commissioner confirmed to RAID in May 2022 that\npolice engaged by the mine provide their services to the mine exclusively and\nnot to the community at large.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/google_earth_preview_poster_raid_webpage.png?itok=SMZfDUpm)\n\n\n\n _Click to view presentationhere (and then click \"present\")_\n\n\n\nBarrick says that since taking back operational control in 2019 from its\nsubsidiary Acacia Mining, it has \u201cradically repaired\u201d community relations and\nestablished \u201cclear boundaries\u201d with local police. RAID\u2019s findings contradict\nthese claims, as well as the suggestion in Barrick\u2019s reporting that there has\nbeen a \u201c[r]eduction in use of force\u201d in mine security operations.\n\n\n\nRAID will formally submit information concerning the most recent human rights\nviolations as part of its complaint to the London Bullion Market Association\n(LBMA), which since 2014 has certified gold mined from North Mara as being\n\u201cresponsibly sourced\u201d. This certification means that North Mara gold may enter\nthe supply chains of some of the world\u2019s largest companies including Apple,\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla.\n\n\n\nThe LBMA recently confirmed that MMTC-PAMP, the Indian refiner that processes\ngold from the North Mara mine, remains on its Good Delivery List. The trade in\ngold continues despite an assessment commissioned by the refiner that ranks\nrisks concerning \"security forces management and potential human rights\nabuses\" as \"high\" (see below).\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_3_scrubbed.png?itok=JbEvaGHh)_Motorcycle\napproaches crossing with North Mara mine road in Nyangoto village \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nRAID has conducted numerous research missions to North Mara, beginning in\n2014. Since Barrick assumed operational control of the mine in 2019, RAID has\ncompleted nine research missions and carried out over 178 interviews in person\nand by phone, including with those injured, witnesses, family members, village\nleaders, local authorities, elected officials, former mine employees, security\npersonnel, and members of the Tanzania Police Force. Nearly all of the\ninterviews were individual, and most lasted for more than an hour.\n\n\n\nRAID published a briefing in March 2022 reporting that at least four people\nhad been killed and seven more seriously injured by police engaged by the mine\nbetween December 2019 and December 2021.\n\n\n\nBetween April and October 2022, RAID completed three more research visits to\nNorth Mara, and documented a further two incidents in which people were killed\nand 19 more in which they were injured by police in mine-related security\noperations since December 2019. Of these, both of the deaths and 18 of the\ninjuries occurred since January 2022. It is the 2022 period on which this\nreport is focused, which should be read as an extension of RAID\u2019s March 2022\nbriefing.\n\n\n\nNearly all of those interviewed by RAID spoke on condition of anonymity due to\nconcerns for their safety or circumstances of employment, which RAID assessed\nwere reasonably held. Accordingly, all names have been changed and care has\nbeen taken to protect identities.\n\n\n\nBarrick is the world\u2019s second largest gold mining company with revenue of\nnearly $12 billion in 2021, and nearly $6 billion in the first half of 2022.\nBarrick is incorporated and headquartered in Canada and is a publicly traded\ncompany listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and New York Stock Exchange\n(NYSE). It plans to include the North Mara mine in northern Tanzania in its\nelite \u201ctier one\u201d portfolio.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_4_scrubbed.png?itok=Q4xwGDl5)\n_Homes in Nyabichune village against backdrop of waste rock pile by North Mara\nmine\u2019s Nyabirama pit, where Kurya residents say they face ongoing pollution of\ndust from the mine \u00a92022 RAID_\n\n\n\nThe North Mara mine began commercial production in 2002. Barrick acquired the\nmine in 2006, which it owned through its local subsidiary, North Mara Gold\nMine Limited. From 2010, the mine was operated by Barrick\u2019s subsidiary,\nAfrican Barrick Gold, which it listed on the London Stock Exchange, retaining\na controlling financial interest. In 2014, African Barrick Gold was renamed\nAcacia Mining. In September 2019, Barrick bought out Acacia Mining\u2019s minority\nshareholders, delisted it, and took it back in-house. Barrick now operates its\nTanzanian mines, including North Mara, through a newly formed company, Twiga\nMinerals, in which the Tanzanian government holds a 16% stake.\n\n\n\nThroughout these changes, Barrick\u2019s shareholding has not fallen below 63.9%\nand it was more often higher.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/history_of_barrick_full_history_of_barrick_gold_mine_in_north_mara_tanzania.png?itok=cwf5qtbs)\n\n\n\nThe latest incidents that RAID has documented follow over a decade of reports\nof serious human rights violations at the North Mara mine. There have been\ncredible reports of at least 77 people killed and 304 people injured, many on\nmultiple occasions, by police responsible for mine security, most of which\noccurred since Barrick acquired the mine in 2006. These figures include the\nreports received in person by a Tanzania Parliamentary inquiry in 2016. Local\nleaders involved in that inquiry told RAID they believed this was an\nunderestimate.\n\n\n\nThe Kurya (sometimes spelled \u2018Kuria\u2019) people are indigenous to an area of east\nAfrica that spans the Tanzania-Kenya border. They are the majority ethnic\ngroup in the Tarime district, where the North Mara mine is located, in\nnorthern Tanzania\u2019s Mara region. For generations, small-scale mining and agro-\npastoralism have been mainstays of the economy for the area\u2019s Kurya\ncommunities, their customary land tenure system an important source of natural\nresource management.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_5_scrubbed.png?itok=VaqqKgGK)\n_Areas for Kurya residents to graze cattle, seen here in Nyabichune village in\nfront of waste rock by the North Mara mine\u2019s Nyabirama pit, have shrunk as the\nmine has expanded \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Afrika Mashariki Gold Mines, which in 1997 was taken over\nby Australian company East African Gold Mines, began exploring the prospects\nfor a large-scale industrial mine, which became the North Mara mine, in an\narea in the Tarime district with seven established Kurya villages. According\nto a former chairperson of one of those villages, interviewed by RAID in\nJanuary 2022, \u201cWhen the mine came, it did not do research and get its own area\nto start mining. It took the area that was already being mined by locals.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe mine\u2019s land acquisition process impacted many households. The former\nchairperson added, \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know a lot about the value of their land.\nThey were just presented with what they were paid, and they had to accept.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose who did not accept faced the risk of being forcibly evicted. According\nto a detailed complaint in 2003 by the Lawyer\u2019s Environmental Action Team\n(LEAT) in Tanzania to the state\u2019s Commission for Human Rights and Good\nGovernance, many such evictions were carried out by members of the Tanzanian\nPolice Force to clear the way for the mine\u2019s development. A Kurya elder who\nwas an elected official at the time told RAID:\n\n\n\n\u201c _They evaluated the land, but when people were called to get their payment,\nthey were subjected to receiving only pennies, so they refused\u2026 For those who\nrefused, they got beaten up really badly [by the police]_.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrior to the mine\u2019s arrival, there had been very limited police presence in\nthe area. The mine\u2019s development brought a significant increase in that\npresence, and with it an increase in violence and human rights violations that\ncontinue to this day (see below).\n\n\n\nThe mine began commercial operations in 2002. Today it comprises two adjacent\npits, Gokona (underground) and Nyabigena (recommencing operations this year),\nand a third, Nyabirama (open pit), which is connected to the others by a mine\nroad that cuts through local villages.\n\n\n\nTo understand the problems associated with the mine, including the killings, a\nKurya human rights defender told RAID, \u201cyou must understand the land issues\u201d.\nThe mine was constructed in the midst of the existing Kurya villages, and the\nland it has claimed extends well into residential areas, with sizeable white\nboulders interspersed throughout villages marking the mine\u2019s property claims.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_6_scrubbed.png?itok=xXHULd-O)\n_Large white boulders positioned next to homes in Nyangoto village mark the\nNorth Mara mine\u2019s property claims \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nIn some areas, the mine wall is separated from homes by only a dirt road.\nAccording to local leaders interviewed by RAID, the mine has failed to provide\nfor a 200-metre buffer zone between its perimeter and local homes, which they\nsaid was inconsistent with Tanzanian law.\n\n\n\nAccording to local leaders and Kurya residents, this close proximity between\ntraditional residential areas and the mine has long been the source of\nproblems, exposing residents to pollution and other environmental harm, and\nthe effects of blasting at the mine, as well as limiting their ability to\ndevelop their land.\n\n\n\nThe mine\u2019s development has also dramatically affected livelihoods, cutting off\nKurya residents from areas where they had traditionally conducted artisanal\nmining and farming. A Kurya resident with a local leadership position told\nRAID in July 2022:\n\n\n\n _\u201c[Our] people rely on gold but the thing is, people have nowhere to go to\naccess rocks because the mine has expanded so extensively. It has taken a vast\narea, displacing people and then expecting people to survive.\u201d_\n\n\n\nUnder Barrick\u2019s operational control, the mine\u2019s expansion has continued as it\nseeks new areas to exploit gold. Again, this is displacing communities. In\nJanuary 2022, a former village chairperson told RAID that such displacement is\nan issue of ongoing and significant concern:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _The little compensation from the mine is causing poverty, it is bringing\npeople down. They are giving up land that is way more valuable than what they\nare getting, and it is making people poorer\u2026 People are being removed now, and\nwe don\u2019t know what will be happening to them. I don\u2019t know why the government\nwon\u2019t defend its people. It is much more in favour of the mine than the\npeople, but it is the people who own the land._ \u201d __\n\n\n\nAccording to the former chairperson, the land acquisition process has led to a\nsignificant deterioration of conditions for the Kurya people in the area:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _It\u2019s really bad, and I think it\u2019s going to have a really bad impact in the\nnear future. A lot of people don\u2019t have the knowledge to make a living from\nother [income] sources, because they have always depended on mining. But now\ntheir land is taken, and even farming areas are scarce for them. It is a major\nchallenge._\n\n\n\n _The biggest impact that it will have is for the children. They also suffer,\nbecause when their parents suffer, children suffer as well._\n\n\n\n _The taking of land without compensation makes people poor, and when people\nbecome poor, they become hungry, literally hungry, and they become desperate,\nand this is why \u2018intruders\u2019 keep going [to the mine] and won\u2019t stop. When\npeople are hungry, they need to feed themselves and so they revert to\nintruding to try to ensure that they can eat._ \u201d\n\n\n\nA Kurya resident with a village leadership position told RAID in July 2022\nthat his community has tried to resist the mine\u2019s harmful impacts. At a\nmeeting in or around April 2022 attended by mine officials, village\nauthorities and the police, community members explained they had few options\nto feed their families other than going to the mine:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _People asked how could they survive? Farming is not enough and they don\u2019t\nknow how to do anything else but mining. What are they expecting us to do? Go\nrob people\u2019s shops to get something to feed our families?_ _People were saying\nto [mine officials and the authorities], \u2018We live here, we see the mine, we\nsee the rocks, and we need to feed our families. We would rather go to the\nmine than rob people, so even if we are shot for going to the mine, we will\nkeep going.\u2019_ \u201d\n\n\n\nRAID sought Barrick\u2019s response to reports that as part of its expansion,\nresidents were being forced to relocate without adequate compensation and\nwithout another property or home to move to, which was inconsistent with the\nstandards by which Barrick says it is \u201cguided\u201d. The company did not respond.\nIn 2020, Barrick said most of the \u201coutstanding land claims at North Mara have\nbeen settled\u201d, though without providing details. The Kurya human rights\ndefender disputed Barrick\u2019s claim to have settled most of the land claims when\nRAID interviewed him in November 2021.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_10_artisanal_mining_scrubbed.png?itok=JTVc3nw_)_Artisanal\nmining, often a joint venture amongst Kurya community members, in Nyabichune\nvillage by the North Mara mine \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nOne of the ways people have sought to survive is by collecting gold-bearing\nmaterial from waste rock areas where the mine dumps rocks that contain too\nlittle gold for it to be sufficiently profitable for the mine to process. In\nprevious years, local residents were permitted to access such areas to try to\nfind small amounts of gold amongst the waste rock, but RAID is told that this\nis no longer the case under Barrick\u2019s operational control. A Kurya man from\nMatongo, one of the surrounding villages, told RAID in August 2022:\n\n\n\n\u201c _The relationship between communities and the mine is not good at all\u2026\nBefore, at least the mine used to dump waste rocks for people and we could go\nand get something. But now, that doesn\u2019t happen anymore. That\u2019s why people\ncan\u2019t stop going, because many people depend on gold bearing rocks. It\u2019s not\nlike people go to the_ _white man_ _\u2019s house to steal, they just go to get\nwaste rocks._ \u201d\n\n\n\nRAID was told that people asked the mine to designate an area where it would\nplace waste rock that local residents could safely access and that they raised\nthe issue in community meetings with the mine. Barrick told RAID that it did\nnot plan to do so, including because in its view it would not be considered\nsustainable.\n\n\n\nEven if it is no longer permitted, local residents say they have no option but\nto continue to try to access the waste rock because the mine has taken areas\non which people had previously depended for income. \u201cYou have a family, you\nhave kids,\u201d one Kurya man from Nyabichune, another of the surrounding\nvillages, explained in June 2022. \u201cIf there is waste material, that is where\nyou at least have a chance to feed your family.\u201d\n\n\n\nPolice assigned to the mine appear to be using the need of those from the\nsurrounding villages for access to waste rock areas to elicit bribes for\naccess. In some cases, RAID found evidence that police specifically targeted\nindividuals who did not pay them or who refused to give them a portion of the\ngold they had found. For more on the security problems posed by the police,\nand views of former members of the mine\u2019s security team regarding the\ninvolvement in unlawful conduct of police engaged by the mine, see RAID\u2019s\nMarch 2022 briefing.\n\n\n\nThe unlawful use of force by Tanzanian police officers engaged by the mine to\nprovide security has long been central to the human rights problems at North\nMara. These officers, referred to as \u201cmine police\u201d by local residents, are\nassigned to the mine, generally rotated through for a period of between six\nweeks and three months, and mostly brought in from outside the area. Since at\nleast 2008, this arrangement has been formalised through Memoranda of\nUnderstanding between the mine and police.\n\n\n\nAs noted above, under these Memoranda, the mine equips, feeds and accommodates\nin barracks built by the mine approximately 150 officers on an ongoing basis.\nIt also pays each officer a daily sum in addition to their regular salary,\nmaking it a particularly lucrative posting. The mine further provides benefits\nto senior officers in the Mara region including monetary payments, vehicles,\nvehicle maintenance, fuel and accommodation within the mine.\n\n\n\n _![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_11_scrubbed_-.png?itok=QfjpCVHL)Green-\nroofed barracks provided by North Mara mine for mine-assigned police, Nyangoto\nvillage in the background_ _\u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nIn respect of each of the cases documented, those RAID interviewed identified\n\u201cmine police\u201d as being involved, including because: (i) of where the police\nhad been posted (for instance, by the mine wall); (ii) they had been in mine\nvehicles, identifiable, for example, by their license plate, colour, make and\nwire-mesh-covered windows; (iii) they were in, or had emerged from, the mine\nsite during a security operation; and\/or (iv) they were communicating by radio\nwith the mine control room, including being directed over radio while being\ntracked by mine security cameras.\n\n\n\nLocal leaders and residents interviewed by RAID are clear that the \u201cmine\npolice\u201d are not the same police as those carrying out routine, day-to-day\npolicing activities relating to community issues in the area.\n\n\n\nAs noted above, according to members of the mine\u2019s security team and police\nofficers interviewed by RAID, the police officers engaged by the mine are\nintegrated within, and are a key part of, the mine\u2019s security operations. For\nmore on the police\u2019s integration, see RAID\u2019s March 2022 briefing.\n\n\n\nAfter Barrick took over operational control of the mine, its President and\nCEO, Mark Bristow, said that \u201cthe police are there to maintain community peace\nand law and order and we are part of that community\u201d. However, police\nofficers, local residents and village leaders say that police guarding the\nmine provide their services to the mine exclusively and not to the community\nat large.\n\n\n\nWhen RAID met the Tanzania Police Force\u2019s Commissioner of Operations and\nTraining in May 2022, he confirmed that the police engaged by the mine under\nthe applicable Memorandum of Understanding are there solely to \u201csafeguard\u201d the\nmine and \u201care just there to protect the investor, that is all\u201d. He further\nexplained that without the mine\u2019s support, \u201cwe would just do regular patrols.\nIf, as police, we go to do special work for an investor, you must pay a\nlittle, otherwise we will not do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarrick did not respond to questions concerning its relationship with the\npolice in relation to the most recent incidents. However, in response to\nRAID\u2019s March 2022 briefing, Barrick stated that \u201c[t]he North Mara Gold Mine\ndoes not manage or control an independent police force\u201d, the \u201cTanzania Police\noperates under its own hierarchical chain of command and makes its own\npolicing decisions\u201d, and \u201c[p]rivate companies such as North Mara Gold Mine\nLimited are not expected to monitor or report on day-to-day police activities\noutside of the mine\u201d. RAID addressed these assertions in its March briefing\nand in its rebuttal to Barrick\u2019s statement.\n\n\n\nWhen Barrick\u2019s position was put to Neema (not her real name), a Kurya woman\nwhose son was recently killed by police guarding the mine, she rejected\nBarrick\u2019s attempt to disclaim responsibility, telling RAID in May 2022:\n\n\n\n\u201c _It starts with the company. Let me explain. If you are hiring people, don\u2019t\nyou have the power to tell them not to kill someone? And if they do kill\nsomeone, don\u2019t you have the power to fire them? So that is why it starts with\nthe company, they are paying the police who do these things. The white man has\nthe power\u2026 to prevent these things from happening, but chooses not to._ \u201d\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_13_scrubbed_-_.png?itok=IXTSVwzy)\n_Mine vehicle used by police deployed at Barrick\u2019s North Mara gold mine \u00a92022\nRAID_\n\n\n\nTo RAID\u2019s knowledge, no police officer has ever been disciplined for the use\nof excessive force at the mine, though it has sought responses from both\nBarrick and the police on this question. In the meeting with RAID this year,\nthe Tanzanian Police Commissioner of Operations and Training said that the\nmine had not raised any allegations of misconduct or excessive force by the\npolice and that he would have been aware had it done so.\n\n\n\nThe Police Commissioner emphasised that police officers are entitled to\nprotect themselves and that they often encounter people throwing stones,\nthough he said that he had never heard of those going to the mine bringing a\nfirearm. Asked if he was aware of complaints by local residents about police\nviolence at the mine, the Police Commissioner replied that, \u201c[t]hese people\ncannot complain because they are criminals\u201d.\n\n\n\nFormer security personnel confirmed to RAID that people entering the mine were\nnot known to bring firearms, but that some caused injuries, including with\nstones and pangas (a machete-like agricultural tool). In their view, it was\nthus particularly important that the mine\u2019s internal security personnel have\n\u201csoft options\u201d, such as foam baton rounds, in order to be able to respond\nappropriately. Thus equipped, they said, involvement of the police, who would\noften use disproportionate force, could be limited. As noted above, Barrick\nremoved these \u201csoft options\u201d from internal security after taking operational\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nThe cases documented by RAID that occurred since January 2022 follow a similar\npattern to those previously reported. RAID did not find evidence establishing\nthat the use of force by the police was justified in any of the cases\ndocumented. On the contrary, RAID found evidence indicating that the use of\nforce was excessive and unjustified, and in many instances deployed as people\nfled or after they had been detained.\n\n\n\nIn all of the new cases documented, those injured or killed were identified as\nbystanders caught up in mine-related security operations, individuals targeted\nby police while in or leaving local villages for alleged mine-related\nwrongdoing, or individuals who were in or had fled the mine and its waste rock\nareas.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_12_scrubbed_-_.png?itok=rw84LF4e)\n_Police officer with mine vehicle, deployed across mine road by the North Mara\nmine\u2019s Nyabirama pit wall_ __ __ _\u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nTwelve of the cases involved shootings, eight with bullets, including both\ndeaths, and the others with a teargas cannister or other large projectile\nfired from launchers. In one of the shootings, the individual was shot twice\nwith bullets, and in another, first with a projectile fired from a launcher\nand then with a bullet.\n\n\n\nIn one such case in or around July 2022, Samba (not his real name) said that\nhe and others had gone to a waste rock area on the mine site. After a period\nof time searching for gold-bearing rocks, the police arrived. He and others\nfled, with the police giving chase. In addition to mine security vehicles\ncarrying Nguvu Moja personnel, there were \u201ca lot of policemen\u201d driving mine\nvehicles. As he approached the mine wall, Samba recalled, \u201cone of them fired\nand shot me in the leg\u201d, which the bullet sliced through. He was still\nstruggling to walk when RAID interviewed him in August.\n\n\n\nIn another case in or around February 2022, Daudi (not his real name)\ndescribed a similar experience of going to a waste rock area with several\ncolleagues when they encountered the police, one of whom shot him in the leg\nwith a bullet as he fled. One of his colleagues, also interviewed by RAID,\nrecalled:\n\n\n\n\u201c _When we were running away towards the wall, [Daudi] was shot and said to\nme, \u2018I\u2019ve been hit\u2019. I started pleading with the police to stop, I asked \u2018why\nare you doing this, we are leaving.\u2019\u2026 The police kept on coming, but we\nmanaged to get to the wall and were able to get over it._ \u201d\n\n\n\nAnother young man shot outside the mine during a mine security operation was\nstill in hiding when RAID interviewed him earlier this year, several weeks\nafter the incident. \u201cThe worry is that when the police catch someone, they can\nbeat them up so bad they can cripple someone, or someone could even lose their\nlife\u201d, he explained. \u201cAnd sometimes people will also get charged falsely.\u201d His\nconcerns are supported by other cases documented by RAID in which those\ndetained by police guarding the mine suffered such treatment.\n\n\n\nAs noted above, and covered in more detail in RAID\u2019s March 2022 briefing,\nRAID\u2019s research indicates that Barrick\u2019s decision to appoint Nguvu Moja and\nthen remove the (less lethal) weapons with which internal security had been\nequipped meant an expanded role for the police and increase in violence was\nforeseeable. This appears to be what has occurred: Kurya community members\nconfirmed that police involvement in mine security operations, and violence\nagainst them, has since increased.\n\n\n\nRAID\u2019s research has found that the enhanced police role in the mine\u2019s security\ncoincides with the use of more aggressive tactics, a number of which are\nunlawful. These include the deliberate targeting and mistreatment of\nindividuals, torture, detention in degrading conditions, the withholding of\nmedical aid, and surveillance of those perceived as problematic for the mine\nin local communities.  \n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_13_scrubbed.png?itok=tFDDy4l4)\n_North Mara mine surveillance tower with CCTV cameras rises above Nyabikondo\nvillage by_ _the Nyabirama pit, as women search for gold-bearing material\nbelow \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nAs part of these tactics, police engaged by the mine have expanded their\nsecurity operations in the surrounding villages. These operations also appear\nto have greater involvement from an elite anti-terrorist unit within the\nTanzanian police, known as the Crisis Response Team (CRT). RAID is unaware of\nany reports or concerns regarding terrorism in the area, nor did it find any\nevidence that the CRT is involved in anti-terrorist work as part of its\ndeployment to North Mara.\n\n\n\nDuring the course of its recent research, RAID documented seven cases\ninvolving torture. Those interviewed described similar brutal tactics used by\nthe police: they had their hands tied or handcuffed, held in place with an\niron or wooden rod that pinned their arms either behind their back or under\ntheir knees, and were then beaten, generally with batons or clubs, often on\ntheir joints, palms or bottom of their feet. In some cases, the individuals\nwere suspended in the air as they were beaten.\n\n\n\nPeter (not his real name) said that he was in a public area near the mine when\npolice arrived and detained him. He was driven to a nearby police station,\nwhere his hands were cuffed, and he was suspended from a rod. \u201cThey beat me so\nbad, hitting me on the joints, the knees, ankles, elbows\u201d with a club, he\nsaid. During the beating, the police demanded to know where he was \u201cselling\nhis rocks\u201d, referring to gold-bearing rocks that they were accusing Peter of\ntaking from the mine. After the beating, he was put in a cell where he was\nheld with others for many days. \u201cI was in pain, my legs and arms were so\nswollen, but there was no medical attention,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn another case, Mhere (not his real name) described being detained in a local\nvillage by police and placed in a mine vehicle, before being driven within and\naround the wall encircling one of the mine\u2019s pits. While in the vehicle, he\nsaid he was beaten and repeatedly electro-shocked with what appeared to be a\ntaser as he was pinned on the vehicle floor. He recalled:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _I felt like every time they would do it, I would die. Every time, I was\nanticipating it, I was always scared if I could take that pain. You know, when\nyou get shocked, you feel like the blood is getting sucked out of your body\u2026.\nThey were saying that I had to agree that I was at the mine and they would\nstop._ \u201d\n\n\n\nAt one point during this episode, while inside the mine walls, the vehicle\nstopped and Mhere was made to get up so that people wearing mine uniforms\ncould inspect him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c _The way the cell is, I could see outside. I could see the vehicle coming\nand we would know that food was here\u2026. The company that supplies food to the\nmine is AKO, and you could see it written on the side of the vehicle. The food\nwas coming for the police. We would only eat when they wouldn\u2019t finish the\nfood._ \u201d\n\n\n\nRAID confirmed with a former driver for AKO, who explained that AKO is the\ncatering company subcontracted by the mine, that he delivered food to the\npolice daily. The driver told RAID, \u201cWe took them breakfast, lunch and dinner.\nThe food was cooked in the mine. Barrick owns the kitchen. We take it straight\nfrom there to the police mess, or take food to other mine workers then to the\npolice mess.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs noted above and the cases described illustrate, in at least two instances\ninvolving targeting and torture of Kurya residents by the police in mine-\nrelated operations, there are indications that mine personnel may have been\naware of the torture. In none of these cases did RAID find evidence that mine\npersonnel took steps to ensure that those responsible were held to account or\nthat medical care was provided.\n\n\n\nThe operations by police guarding the mine seeking to target suspected\nintruders and possibly others are increasing insecurity and human rights\nviolations in residential areas, an issue identified in RAID\u2019s March briefing.\n\u201cThere is a big difference with security now\u201d, a Kurya man from Kewanja, one\nof the surrounding villages, told RAID in July 2022, \u201cthe mine police come to\ncommunities, even at night, and knock on people\u2019s doors when they are sleeping\nand just arrest people.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Kurya people from the surrounding villages, during these\noperations, police regularly fire live ammunition and teargas\nindiscriminately, including around children, break into homes without a\nwarrant, damage property and conduct arbitrary beatings and arrests. Another\nKurya man from Kewanja village interviewed by RAID in June 2022 described how\npolice from the mine had recently broken the door of his family home and\narrested him and his brother, without showing them a warrant, and accused them\nof going to the mine. He told RAID:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _there is always mine police going to the communities. Sometimes the police\nuse vehicles that spray itchy water and kids get affected. People who have\ndone nothing wrong get caught up with what police do\u2026. we just live around\nthis area, but we have no peace._ \u201d\n\n\n\nNeema (not her real name), whose son was recently killed by police guarding\nthe mine, told RAID in May 2022:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _We warn our kids not to engage with the police. We tell them to pass\nsomewhere else if they see them\u2026. Given what goes on around here you worry\neveryday if your children will come back home alive when they leave for\nschool._ \u201d\n\n\n\nShe explained to RAID that the firing of teargas by those she referred to as\nmine police is an ongoing issue that affects children particularly:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _Sometimes the [teargas] smoke will enter the home and babies suffer a lot,\nyou will find them crying, and they cannot protect themselves._\n\n\n\n _What are they doing to this generation?_ \u201d\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_7_scrubbed.png?itok=CQbJqRix)\n_Children on their way home from school by the North Mara mine\u2019s Nyabirama pit\nwall, Nyabichune village \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nAs RAID reported in its March briefing, the police engaged by the mine on an\nongoing basis include members of the Field Force Unit (FFU), a special\ndivision within the police force responsible for riot control. According to\nformer mine security personnel, even prior to Barrick assuming operational\ncontrol of the mine, they also included members of the Crisis Response Team\n(CRT), a \u201cS.W.A.T.-style\u201d police unit, armed and trained by the US government,\nthat was formed in 2014 to address terrorism threats. Those from surrounding\nvillages and former mine security personnel described members of the CRT as\nbeing particularly \u201caggressive\u201d. As one resident said, \u201c[t]hey don\u2019t laugh\nwith people\u201d but \u201cjust start firing\u201d. Another told RAID, \u201c[t]he CRT is very\nsharp and very involved, and very aggressive\u201d.\n\n\n\nResidents told RAID that it can be difficult to differentiate CRT and regular\nFFU officers, as they are similarly attired. However, in many of the recent\ncases documented, witnesses identified the police involved as being CRT and\ndriving vehicles provided by the mine, which they described as white Land\nCruisers that, unlike those provided by the mine to regular police officers,\nwere open at the back, with piping and green canvas.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/_nm_nov_briefing_image_-\n_scrubbed.png?itok=cosdKwtl) _Mine vehicle used by police deployed on mine\nroad by North Mara mine\u2019s Nyabirama pit \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nWhen asked why they believed the officers to be from the CRT, witnesses said\nthat this was how the officers identified themselves, or that they overheard\nmine personnel referring to them as CRT. For instance, one witness responded,\n\u201cI know the CRT, that\u2019s what they called themselves.\u201d He also said that\nregular officers\u2019 \u201cuniforms have numbers to identify them. The CRTs go to the\ncommunity with guns plus batons and handhoe handles [commonly used by police\nthere as long wooden clubs] and don\u2019t have numbers so that no one can report\u201d\nthem. Another told RAID that he could identify the CRT by the vehicle\u2019s number\nplate.\n\n\n\nBarrick did not respond to RAID\u2019s question regarding services being provided\nto the mine by the CRT, but the frequency with which witnesses implicated them\nin the recent violence indicates that they are playing a more extensive role\nin mine security since Barrick assumed operational control.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_featured_thumbnail_scrubbed.png?itok=oXZoL4vr)\n_Mine vehicle used by police, with police officers in the back, along _the\nNorth Mara mine wall at Nyabirama pit \u00a92021__\n\n\n\nAs a Kurya man from one of the surrounding villages explained to RAID, \u201c[n]ow,\nit is all about the CRT. When something happens, the CRT goes there. When\nthere is a certain issue, it is the CRT.\u201d Another separately confirmed to RAID\nthat \u201c[t]he CRT are much more involved now in security,\u201d and a third told RAID\nthat now \u201cthe CRT is the one that the white man prioritises\u201d. All of these\ninterviews occurred in 2022.\n\n\n\nAs RAID has reported in relation to previous cases, contrary to international\nstandards, those injured in the documented incidents occurring in 2022 were\nnot provided necessary medical treatment \u201cat the earliest possible moment\u201d or\nat all. Further, the mine\u2019s use of the police continued to impede injured\nindividuals\u2019 access to proper medical treatment, which in most instances they\nhad to forgo or obtain covertly, including for injuries as serious as bullet\nwounds. For more on these issues, see RAID\u2019s March 2022 briefing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c _We were told that anybody who goes to the mine will be shot because the\ngovernment has a joint venture with the mine, so the mine is the government\u2019s\nproperty\u2026. The mine people seemed to be in line with what the police were\nsaying. The [mine\u2019s] security manager forbade people from going to the mine._\n\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked by RAID if anyone from the mine corrected the police or said that people\nwere not to be shot if they went to the mine, he said that no one from the\nmine had done so. Another attendee, interviewed separately by RAID, said:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _I think they were trying to threaten people. They said if anyone entered\nthe mine, they were going to get shot\u2026 It was a policeman who said that. There\nwas pushback from village and hamlet chairmen who said that \u2018no, you can\u2019t do\nthat\u2019._ \u201d\n\n\n\nWhen asked if mine personnel also objected, he said that they did not. All\nfive of those from local villages who attended one of the meetings, each\ninterviewed separately by RAID, confirmed that they understood the message to\nbe a threat.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c _I don\u2019t think people are free to speak critically about the mine. Where can\nyou be free to criticise the mine? Where would be your platform? You can\u2019t go\nanywhere to complain._ \u201d\n\n\n\nThe leader connected this problem with Barrick\u2019s partnership with the\nTanzanian government, explaining:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _Now the government has a stake in the company, so when something happens\nthe mine just throws responsibility to the government. The government doesn\u2019t\nwant to be dragged to court, so it finds ways to hurt people more._ \u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, asked if she would be comfortable being identified in RAID\u2019s\nreport, a Kurya woman from Nyabichune village said no, explaining her reasons\nas follows:  \n\n\n\n\u201c _The white man is here for the gold. They are with the government. If they\nhappen to know I am speaking and giving secrets about the mine, they might\ntarget me or my sons. It is really people from the government, the mine is\nwhere they eat from. Even the village chairmen, the sungu-sungu [community]\nguards, they get paid by the mine. And if they think I am putting those who\nbenefit from the mine at risk, there is people\u2019s hate._ \u201d\n\n\n\nSome of those who were reportedly injured by police guarding the mine were not\nprepared to meet with RAID out of fear they might face reprisals should they\nspeak about their experience. Accordingly, those incidents are not among the\nhuman rights violations referred to in this report.  \n\n\n\nLocal and international human rights groups and institutions, including the UN\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, have raised concerns that in recent years\nthe Tanzanian government has overseen an increase in the repression of\njournalists, opposition party members and human rights defenders, and the\nclosing of democratic and civic space. As part of that repression, human\nrights defenders, reporters and opposition politicians have been threatened,\narbitrarily detained, violently attacked, abducted and disappeared. The\nCanadian government has also recently expressed particular concern regarding\nthe human rights implications of restrictions on NGOs operating in Tanzania.  \n\n\n\nIn correspondence, RAID sought Barrick\u2019s response to concerns about the\nrepression of freedom of expression and the meetings at which threats were\nreported. Barrick says that it does \u201cnot tolerate threats, intimidation, or\nattacks against human rights defenders.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn its response, Barrick did not address these concerns or threats, but\ninstead attached what the company described as a \u201cconfirmation statement\u201d,\ndated 13 July 2022, and signed by 22 local leaders. The statement said that,\n\u201cNMGM [North Mara Gold Mine] strongly observes and upholds principles of human\nrights and dignity\u201d and that RAID\u2019s reports of human rights abuses were\n\u201cfalse\u201d, and urged authorities to take action against RAID, referencing\nlegislation that the Canadian government had identified as cause for concern.\n\n\n\nAccording to Barrick, at a meeting it held with local leaders three days\nbefore the statement was signed, \u201castonishingly\u201d none of the leaders said they\nknew of RAID, nor did any of them corroborate the concerns or allegations of\nhuman rights violations. Barrick says the ruling party\u2019s local Member of\nParliament, the Hon. Mwita Waitara, also attended the meeting.\n\n\n\nIn fact, RAID regularly consults with local leadership, although since Barrick\nassumed operational control of the mine, RAID has found that fewer local\nleaders are willing to meet to discuss human rights issues, and those who have\nagreed to such meetings have done so on condition that they are confidential.\n\n\n\nRAID advised Barrick of letters addressed to the mine, officially stamped by\nthe same village authorities whose representatives signed the \u201cconfirmation\nstatement\u201d, which specifically reference violence by police guarding the mine.\nMP Mwita Waitara also features in a publicly-posted video speaking at a\nfuneral of a young man, whom he says the police killed. MP Waitara relates the\nyoung man\u2019s death, which he says was intentionally caused, to the broader\nissue of police violence at and around the mine, stating that, unlike at other\nmine sites in Tanzania, young people living in the area are getting killed.\n\n\n\nFinally, RAID noted that the \u201cconfirmation statement\u201d underscores concerns\nexpressed by Kurya residents and village leaders about speaking freely. The UN\nDeclaration on human rights defenders provides for the right to unhindered\naccess to, and communication with, non-governmental organisations for the\nprotection of human rights. In response, Barrick said that RAID was attempting\nto \u201cdiscredit the local leaders\u201d, but has not addressed the concerns regarding\nrepression of freedom of expression or threats.\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/www.raid-\nuk.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/nm_nov_briefing_image_8_scrubbed.png?itok=UB6jVfDn)\n_Public road divides Muruambe hamlet of Kewanja village and the North Mara\nmine\u2019s Gokona pit \u00a92021 RAID_\n\n\n\nBarrick states publicly that it seeks \u201cto facilitate access to remedy\u201d and\nthat it has a grievance mechanism at North Mara that received 10 grievances in\n2021. However, local residents have consistently told RAID that they are\nunaware of any grievance mechanism at the mine, and none of those injured or\nthose whose family member was killed has received remedy, though several told\nRAID that individuals had communicated with the mine about their cases.\n\n\n\nRAID raised these issues previously with Barrick, but although Barrick stated\nit worked to ensure a community grievance mechanism \u201cis accessible to all\ncommunity members\u201d, it provided no details as to how RAID or local residents\ncould find more information about the mechanism.\n\n\n\nFor more on the absence of remedy at the North Mara mine, see RAID\u2019s March\n2022 briefing.\n\n\n\nIn cases that arose prior to Barrick\u2019s assumption of operational control in\n2019, the lack of remedy or justice led local residents to pursue claims for\nkillings and assaults at the mine in the UK, where Barrick\u2019s subsidiary,\nAcacia Mining, was incorporated.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Tanzanian residents brought a legal case to the UK courts for\nkillings and assaults by security forces at the North Mara mine. Acacia Mining\nsettled the legal action in 2015.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, another UK legal action was initiated by Tanzanian residents for\nongoing killings and assaults between 2014 and September 2019. The action\nincludes claims concerning a nine-year-old girl who was killed by a mine\nvehicle driven by police, and four women who were fired upon while gathering\naround her body. In 2022, a UK court order obliged Barrick\u2019s subsidiaries to\nreview up to approximately 100,000 documents for disclosure related to its\nsecurity operations and human rights abuses at the mine. The case is ongoing,\nand Barrick\u2019s subsidiaries deny liability.\n\n\n\nAs noted above, since 2014, gold from the North Mara mine has been certified\nas \u201cresponsibly sourced\u201d by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA),\nwhich describes itself as \u201cthe independent precious metals authority\u201d.  That\ncertification assures gold produced by the mine can enter the supply chains of\nmany of the world\u2019s major companies, including Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet\nand Microsoft.\n\n\n\nIn March 2022, on the basis of the killings and assaults detailed in its\nbriefing of that month, RAID submitted a complaint under the LBMA\u2019s Incident\nReview Process. In July 2022,  the LBMA issued the North Mara mine\u2019s refiner,\nMMTC-PAMP, part of the Swiss-based MKS PAMP Group, another Responsible\nSourcing Certificate. On 4 November 2022, the LBMA issued a statement\nconfirming that MMTC-PAMP remained on its Good Delivery List. Citing an\nassessment commissioned by MMTC-PAMP, the LBMA said that it \u201crecognises the\nprogress that has been made in relation to the North Mara Gold Mine\u201d. RAID has\nreceived no information from the LBMA as to how this decision was made, nor\nthe status of its complaint.\n\n\n\nIn a corresponding statement, MMTC-PAMP said that an \u201cindependent assessment\u201d\nby its appointed consultancy, Synergy Global, \u201cconfirmed MMTC-PAMP\u2019s decision\nto continue to source from the mine.\u201d It said that the assessment \u201cconcludes\nthat there were additional measurable improvements in the managements [sic] of\nrisks\u201d at the mine.\n\n\n\nMMTC-PAMP published a short executive summary of the assessment, dated 12\nSeptember 2022 and based on a five-day site assessment visit to the mine in\nFebruary 2022. The summary states that \u201c[n]o part of this document may be\nreproduced without the prior written approval of\u201d not just Synergy but\nBarrick, with which the site assessment was coordinated and which reviewed the\nreport prior to finalisation. The full assessment has not been made public,\nnor have its Terms of Reference despite requests by RAID.\n\n\n\nThe executive summary refers to \u201cmeasurable improvement in the management of\nthe risks\u201d and recommends continued trading with the mine. Yet it also states\nthat \u201cthe potential significant adverse risks remain high, relating to\nsecurity forces management, land issues and grievance management\u201d, noting\n\u201congoing alleged incidents of fatalities and serious injuries linked to public\nsecurity forces managing\u2026illegal intrusions\u201d. More concerning still, it states\nthat \u201cit is not necessarily expected that all agreed actions can be completed\nwithin a defined period of time, nor that it is possible to demonstrate\nelimination (or significant reduction) in these risks within the period\u201d. The\nimplication of this statement appears to be that it is expected that the\nmine\u2019s ongoing operations may lead to further killings, torture and other\nserious human rights violations against Kurya residents, and that this need\nnot prevent Barrick\u2019s business partners from continuing to trade with it, nor\nthe LBMA from continuing to certify the gold produced by the North Mara mine.\n\n\n\nThe executive summary provides little support for its conclusion that the mine\nhas \u201cmade significant measurable progress managing security and human rights\u201d.\nIt states that this progress has related particularly to private security,\nnoting that the mine has contracted a Tanzanian company (Nguvu Moja), which is\nnot armed and takes a \u201cnon-confrontational approach\u201d. As detailed above,\nhowever, Barrick\u2019s decision to appoint and disarm Nguvu Moja guards has\ncoincided with a predictably enhanced role for the police in mine-related\nsecurity operations, and an intensification in violence.\n\n\n\nThe executive summary does not address the question of whether there has been\na change in the level or nature of security-related violence, which is a\nsignificant omission for an assessment purporting to measure improvements in\nsecurity management and human rights. Rather, the executive summary identifies\nsteps that it says have \u201ccontributed to a significant reduction in the number\nof arrests of intruders, despite the increase in attempted intrusions\u201d. It is\nunclear how this measure indicates improved security management, particularly\nwhen accompanied by evidence of intensifying violence. This is especially so\nwhen much of that violence is inflicted on those who could simply be arrested\nif they were indeed engaged in illegal activities.\n\n\n\nRead here the steps that RAID has urged Barrick to take to address the ongoing\nviolence by police engaged by the North Mara mine.\n\n\n\nRAID is a Registered Charity No. 1150846 and a not-for-profit Company Limited\nby Guarantee No. 4895859.

Yet\ndefinitions concerning the relationship between the environment and justice\nhave changed over time, as well as the approaches and ideas that activists\nemploy to reach their goals. Tracy E. Perkin's new book, _Evolution of a\nMovement: Four Decades of California Environmental Justice Activism_ ,\npublished by the University of California Press in 2022, offers insight into\nhalf of century of the changing conditions of environmental activism.\n\n\n\n\"Despite living and working in California, one of the county's most\nenvironmentally progressive states, environmental justice activists have spent\ndecades fighting for clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and safe,\nhealthy communities. _Evolution of a Movement_ tells their story\u2014from the\noften-raucous protests of the 1980s and 1990s to activists' growing presence\ninside the halls of the state capitol in the 2000s and 2010s.

Yet since that term is under two\nyears and as Lombard does not present a danger to society, he will not spend\ntime behind bars under French court rules.\n\n\n\nThe traumatic episode of workers\u2019 deaths at the company in the late 2000s led\nto deep soul-searching over corporate culture in France.\n\n\n\nThe court found Orange guilty of the same charge, and fined it 75,000 euros\n($83,200).\n\n\n\n\u201cIn financial terms, the sentence is light, but this is the first time a\nFrench company gets a criminal conviction for moral harassment and that is\nvery bad in terms of reputation,\u201d said a lawyer specializing in white-collar\ncrime.\n\n\n\nThe lawyer, who declined to be named, added the ruling will be a major concern\nfor other companies as it sets a precedent for corporate responsibility in\nmoral harassment and employee burn-out cases.\n\n\n\nMany individual managers have been convicted of harassment - and often fired\nas a result - but not companies themselves.\n\n\n\nOrange, which in 2018 had core earnings of 3.3 billion euros ($3.66 billion),\nsaid it would not appeal the verdict.\n\n\n\nOrange has previously acknowledged the suffering expressed by victims and\nrecognized there may have been management errors in implementing the\nrestructuring plan but denies there was any systemic plan or intention to\nharass employees.\n\n\n\nProsecutors argued that some of the methods employed in a deep restructuring\nof the company, then known as France Telecom, after privatization prompted a\nwave of suicides.\n\n\n\nLombard, 77, and three other former Orange executives also accused of \u201cmoral\nharassment\u201d have denied any wrongdoing and said the restructuring plan was an\neconomic necessity.\n\n\n\nOrange used the last day of the trial in July to offer compensation to victims\nand relatives of those who died. The presiding judge estimated that claims for\ncompensation so far were about 2 million euros ($2.25 million).\n\n\n\nThe case centers around a drive by the former state monopoly to shed 22,000\njobs and redeploy another 10,000 as it adapted to competition in the private\nsector.\n\n\n\nIn a country where workers employed on state contracts expect jobs for life\nand employees in both private and public sectors enjoy strong labor law\nprotection, unions alleged that management sought ways to encourage workers to\nquit or accept reassignment.\n\n\n\nProsecutors listed at least 18 suicides and 13 suicide attempts between April\n2008 and June 2010.

Through its federal court enforcement action,\nthe Commission is seeking to prohibit Gerber from making the alleged false and\nunsubstantiated allergy-prevention claims.\n\n\n\n\u201cParents trusted Gerber to tell the truth about the health benefits of its\nformula, and the company\u2019s ads failed to live up to that trust,\u201d said Jessica\nRich, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cGerber didn\u2019t have\nevidence to back up its claim that Good Start Gentle formula reduces the risk\nof babies developing their parents\u2019 allergies.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC alleges that since 2011, Gerber has advertised its\nGood Start Gentle formula through advertisements that ran on television, in\nmagazines, at point-of-sale displays, online, and in other promotional\nmaterial. Good Start Gentle sells for about $24 for a 23.2-ounce package of\npowdered formula.\n\n\n\nGood Start Gentle is made with partially hydrolyzed whey proteins (PHWP).\nGerber claims that feeding babies this formula, instead of formula made with\nintact cow\u2019s milk proteins, will prevent or reduce the risk that they will\ndevelop allergies. In its ads, Gerber promotes Good Start Gentle by saying,\nfor example:\n\n\n\nAlso, a sticker on the package states that Good Start Gentle Formula is the:\n\n\n\nThe agency\u2019s complaint charges that Gerber lacked the scientific\nsubstantiation to make these general allergy-prevention claims, in violation\nof the FTC Act.\n\n\n\nIn addition, according to the FTC, Gerber\u2019s ads also misrepresent that Good\nStart Gentle has qualified or received approval for a Food and Drug\nAdministration health claim. For example, some ads prominently featured a gold\nbadge stating that Good Start Gentle is the \u201c1st and Only\u201d formula that \u201cMeets\nFDA Qualified Health Claim.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Gerber petitioned the FDA for permission to make a claim connecting\nPWHP with the reduced risk of _one_ type of allergy, atopic dermatitis, in\ninfants. The FDA allowed Gerber to make the narrow claim but only if Gerber\ncarefully qualified its statement to make it clear that there is \u201clittle\nscientific evidence\u201d for the relationship.\n\n\n\nThe Commission vote authorizing staff to file the federal court complaint was\n5-0. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey on October 29, 2014.\n\n\n\n **NOTE:** The Commission files a complaint when it has \u201creason to believe\u201d\nthat the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission\nthat a proceeding is in the public interest.

(Nestle) is facing a class-action lawsuit\nover claims that its Boost Glucose Control drinks help diabetic consumers\nmanage their blood sugar levels. The case, _Owen v. Nestle Healthcare\nNutrition, Inc.,_ was filed in New Jersey District Court. The suit alleges\nthat Nestle makes druglike claims about the drinks, which have not been tested\nor approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and that the products\nmislead consumers into believing that the drinks help control blood glucose\nlevels when in fact Nestle's own study revealed they do not.\n\n\n\nPlaintiff Steven Owen's lawsuit involves Nestle's BOOST-brand Glucose Control\nover-the-counter drinks with the name \"Glucose Control.\" As described in his\ncomplaint, the products are labeled \"Glucose Control\" and prominently state in\nbold, capitalized font that they \"HELP MANAGE BLOOD SUGAR\" and\/or that they\nare \"DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES.\"\n\n\n\nPlaintiff, a diagnosed diabetic, purchased a 24-pack of BOOST Glucose Control\nin or around April 2022 from Amazon for $38.99. He claims that the products\ndid not \"control\" his Glucose or \"manage his blood sugar\" as he expected it\nwould in light of the product's labeling. \"Defendant's prominent and\nsystematic mislabeling of the Products and its false and deceptive advertising\nform a pattern of unlawful and unfair business practices that harms the public\nand, if unstopped, could continue to lead to substantial harm,\" his complaint\nstates. His proposed class-action suit includes claims for breach of warranty,\nbreach of implied warranty, unjust enrichment, and violations of New Jersey\nconsumer protection laws.\n\n\n\nIn his complaint, Owens specifically maintains that Nestle's Boost products\nmake unproven health claims. \"Critically, Nestle's marketing and labeling are\ntantamount to express and\/or implied disease claims relating to the prevention\nand control of diabetes,\" the suit alleges. \"Such claims made on dietary\nsupplements are prohibited as a matter of law and further render the claims\nmisleading and deceptive.\"\n\n\n\nUnder 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.14(a)(1), a health claim is \"any claim made on the label\nor in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by\nimplication . . . characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease\nor health-related condition.\" Thus, claims on food labels are governed by\nFDA's health claims regulations if they include either express or implied\nreferences to both a substance and a disease. Pursuant to 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\n101.14(e), health claims may not be made unless such claims are expressly\nreviewed and preauthorized by the FDA. A product that makes unauthorized\nhealth claims is considered misbranded pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(r).\n\n\n\nIn his complaint, Owens contends that consumers could understand Nestle's\nrepresentations to mean that they can use the products to effectively control\nglucose levels and manage blood sugar. For instance, he alleges that the name\nof the Product, \"BOOST Glucose Control,\" is an implicit or express health\nclaim because it purports to control a health-related condition, namely the\ninability to control glucose. He further maintains that Nestle's statement\nthat the products are \"DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES\" is an implicit or\nexpressed health claim because it denotes a relationship between the drink and\ndiabetes.\n\n\n\nOwens' complaint further alleges that Nestle's product deceptively represents\nthat they control and manage glucose. \"Representations that the products\ncontrol glucose and 'help manage blood sugar' conveys to the consumer that the\nproducts affirmatively do something to control blood sugar: that whatever\none's blood glucose is at the time they take the products, drinking the\nproducts will make it better,\" the complaint states. \"But this is false, as\ndemonstrated by the clinical study that Nestle discusses on a part of its\nwebsite.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the complaint, Nestle's own clinical trial found that the\nproducts were associated with a lesser rise in glucose levels as compared to a\nstandard nutritional drink in people with type 2 diabetes. However, they did\nnot show that they controlled blood sugar. \"Shockingly, the Products do not\ncontrol glucose at all, but rather only produce a slightly favorable response\nto glucose levels as compared to one other unidentified product,\" the\ncomplaint states.\n\n\n\nGiven the rise in lawsuits alleging false advertising and mislabeling, food\nand drink manufacturers must be particularly cautious when making statements\nthat may be construed as \"health claims.\" Such claims are highly regulated by\nthe FDA and must meet stringent legal requirements. To avoid unintended\nliability, we encourage manufacturers to consult with experienced counsel.\n\n\n\n _The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

One NGO, Plastic\nSoup Foundation, accuses Nestl\u00e9, Unilever (in 8th place) and Coca-Cola (9th)\nof backing \u201cfalse solutions\u201d to plastics waste and calls out Coca Cola and\nNestl\u00e9 as two of the top three contributors to marine plastic pollution.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, plastic pollution had barely registered on the public\nconsciousness.

They come under\nattack for financing coal power, notably the controversial Van Phong 1 coal\npower station in Vietnam. World Bank Group is the fifth most criticized brand,\naccused of \u201cquietly bankrolling\u201d Indonesian coal mining companies, while Adani\nGroup is at number ten on account of its controversial Carmichael coalmine\nproject in Queensland, Australia.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, financial institutions that are rejecting fossil fuels are\nrewarded with a place on the NGO ten most praised list. AXA, Allianz and QBE\nInsurance Group are commended for taking steps to stop financing coal, in\nparticular for refusing to finance the Adani Carmichael coal project.\n\n\n\n**About the quarterly rankings**\n\n\n\nSIGWATCH has been compiling quarterly rankings of brands most praised and most\ncriticized by NGOs for three years.

It consists of a top-four primary, where candidates of all\nparties run on the same primary ballot, and a ranked-choice general election.\nWith ranked choice, voters order the candidates on the ballot in order of\npreference, and the candidates' votes are redistributed up to the top until\none earns over 50% of the vote.\n\n\n\nVoters \u2014 confused or not \u2014 ultimately elected Mary Peltola, a Democrat, out of\na 48-candidate field that included everyone from the 2008 vice-presidential\nnominee Sarah Palin to Santa Claus, a socialist City Council member in the\ncity of North Pole.\n\n\n\nThe Alaska special election is just one of the more than 120 congressional\nspecial elections conducted over the past two decades, an Insider analysis\nfound.\n\n\n\nWhile special elections sometimes open unexpected doors for new candidates\nlike now-Sen. Jon Ossoff in Georgia and Rep. Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania,\nthey're expensive, have low turnout, and are sometimes chaotic affairs that\nbleed taxpayers, confuse and exhaust voters, and, in many cases, can be\navoided if lawmakers choose to step aside earlier.\n\n\n\nInsider found that 55 of the special elections from the past two decades, 45%,\nwere prompted by a Congress member resigning before the end of their term.\nOne-quarter of those special elections, 31, followed a member getting elected\nor appointed to another position.\n\n\n\nAnd 35 of those special elections, nearly 30%, resulted from members dying in\noffice (except for Missouri's Mel Carnahan, who was posthumously elected to\nthe US Senate after dying in a plane crash), or resigning for age-related\nhealth concerns.\n\n\n\nThe Constitution sets minimum ages to serve in the US House (25) and Senate\n(30).\n\n\n\nBut it doesn't set a maximum. Nor has Congress passed a term-limit law that\nwould forbid lawmakers from serving, say, more than a dozen years. Therefore,\nany member of Congress may, like Young did, serve in perpetuity, their\npolitical careers interrupted only by constituent intervention or their own\nmortality.\n\n\n\nFor better or for worse, such a system has contributed to Congress being\nsignificantly older than the population it represents. As the current\ncongressional session began last year, the median age of a House member was\n58, while the median age of a senator was 64.5 **.** The median age of the\ngeneral American population? Just short of 39.\n\n\n\nSpecial elections spurred by lawmakers dying in office or resigning because of\nhealth complications are on the rise.\n\n\n\nYoung and Rep. Alcee Hastings of Florida, a Democrat, entered the current\nsession of Congress as two of the US House's three oldest members. Both have\nsince died while in office.\n\n\n\nThose who die or resign for health reasons while serving in Congress are\nusually well into their golden years. The average age of such members of\nCongress was 84 during the 115th Congress, from 2017 to 2019. That figure has\ntrended down \u2014 to 68 years old \u2014 in the current congressional session.\n\n\n\nSen. Robert Byrd, 92, Sen. Daniel Inouye, 88, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, 89, and\nRep. Louise Slaughter, 88, are other members of Congress who served into their\nlate 80s or early 90s before dying in office and, as a result, triggering a\nspecial election. Sens. Thad Cochran, 80, and James Inhofe, 87, set off\nspecial elections by announcing their resignations before the end of their\nterms.\n\n\n\nInsider's \"Red, White, and Gray\" series explores the costs, benefits, and\ndangers of life in a democracy helmed by those of advanced age, where issues\nof profound importance to the nation's youth and future \u2014 technology, civil\nrights, energy, the environment \u2014 are largely in the hands of those whose\nprimes have passed.\n\n\n\n\"There will be questions about how long members of Congress serve and what's\nthe time for them to maybe think about not holding on until the end,\" Karen\nOwen, a political-science professor at the University of West Georgia and\ncoauthor of a 2021 book on special elections, told Insider.\n\n\n\nSpecial elections routinely attract special attention. With that attention\ncomes especially ridiculous amounts of money, often from wealthy people and\nspecial interests who have little interest in picking the best person to\nrepresent the good people of Alaska or Nebraska or Louisiana but sure want to\nadd or retain a congressional seat for their political party of choice.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, voters in Arizona and Georgia were bombarded with advertising as out-\nof-state cash poured into the US Senate special elections prompted,\nrespectively, by the death of Republican Sen. John McCain and the health-\nrelated resignation of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson.\n\n\n\nVoters in both states will now decide whether the winners of those special\nelections \u2014 Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia,\nalso a Democrat \u2014 deserve their own six-year terms.\n\n\n\n\"People are just really tired. We've never had a moment where we haven't been\nin an election cycle, Owen said of Georgia, calling the deluge of ads \"a\nconstant barrage.\"\n\n\n\nCompounding voter fatigue is the once-a-decade redrawing of political lines\nthat have turned some special elections into messy games of political musical\nchairs.\n\n\n\nIn California, New York, and Texas, resignations spurred special elections for\ncongressional districts that will no longer exist come January. One candidate,\nPat Ryan of New York, ran in the special general election for one House seat,\nthe Upstate New York-based 19th District. He also ran in the regular primary\nfor another, the neighboring 18th District \u2014 on the same day.\n\n\n\nThe high-profile 2017 special Senate election in Alabama between former\nfederal prosecutor Doug Jones, a Democrat, and Roy Moore, a Republican, hit\nover $48 million in campaign spending and likely cost the state over $15\nmillion to conduct between the primary, the primary runoff, and the general\nelection.\n\n\n\nSpecial congressional elections are, on balance, less democratic than regular\nelections.\n\n\n\nThey tend to have much lower voter participation than general elections, and\nin safe blue or red seats, candidates win crowded primaries with a slim\nplurality of the vote.\n\n\n\nJust over 55,000 voters cast ballots in the 11-way special Democratic primary\nelection to replace Hastings, the South Florida representative, after he died\nof cancer in April 2021. That's compared with over 62,000 who voted to elect\nhim in his last primary and over 250,000 in his last general election, in\nNovember 2020.\n\n\n\nAnd only 11,662 of them chose Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick to represent the\nBroward County-based district of over 800,000 people in total, in a primary\nwhere she ultimately beat out the second-place candidate by just five votes.\n\n\n\nThe prolonged special-election process also left the district's constituents\nwithout a vote in Washington for over nine months until Cherfilus-McCormick\nwon the January general election, one that just 55,703 people voted in.\n\n\n\nIn Alabama, \"even as Roy Moore was making national headlines for all the wrong\nreasons, turnout was still really low,\" at just over 40%, Ryan Williamson, the\nresident fellow for governance at the R Street Institute, a Washington-based\nthink tank, and an assistant professor at Auburn University, told Insider.\n\n\n\n\"That multimillion-dollar cost of holding those elections becomes even more\negregious when you consider how few people are participating in them,\"\nWilliamson added.\n\n\n\nSpecial-election efficiency and cost control often depend on whether it's a\nSenate or House race. While states' governors may temporarily appoint people\nto vacant Senate seats, Article I of the Constitution requires all House\nmembers to be elected, not appointed, which leads to often inconveniently\ntimed special elections.\n\n\n\nAn extreme example of this is found in California's Central Valley.\n\n\n\nJames Kus, the top election official in Fresno County, was implementing\nCalifornia's new congressional-district lines when powerful GOP Rep. Devin\nNunes, a top Trump ally in Congress, left office to lead the Trump Media &\nTechnology Group, the company behind the former president's Truth Social\nplatform.\n\n\n\nDeciphering who is running for which congressional seat effectively requires a\nspreadsheet or flow chart. California's new congressional map splits Nunes'\nold 22nd District into four.\n\n\n\nThis meant that in June, many voters had to vote for two sets of congressional\nrepresentatives for two geographically distinct districts. The system \"is not\ndesigned\" for such a scenario, Kus said. **** But he still had access to the\nold district lines and was able to program a one-time special district into\nhis county's voting system.\n\n\n\n\"I voted for two congresspeople \u2014 that's a unique situation that really\nshouldn't happen in California ever,\" Kus told Insider. \"I'd rather imagine\nthat will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the voters of Fresno and\nmyself.\"\n\n\n\nIn New York, messy, protracted court battles over the state's new political\nmaps required two primary elections for one set of offices in June and another\nin August, doubling the costs and labor for election officials.\n\n\n\n\"We're used to having to think on our feet now in New York,\" Dustin Czarny, a\nDemocratic election commissioner in Syracuse-based Onondaga County, told\nInsider. \"I have to be honest: This year is the worst.\"\n\n\n\nTwo special elections in Upstate and Western New York alongside the August\nprimary added to the costs \u2014 ones that taxpayers had to shoulder.\n\n\n\nThe extra primary election alone cost the state $40 to $60 million, and Czarny\nestimated that the two special elections on top of that would increase costs\nby 25% to 50% in the affected counties.\n\n\n\nAlameda County, California, in the Bay Area, estimates that a stand-alone\nspecial election costs $19 to $21 a voter, as opposed to $7 to $9 a voter for\na regular primary election and $4 to $6 a voter for a general election.\n\n\n\nIn nearby Marin County, a countywide election costs between $800,000 and $1\nmillion.\n\n\n\nLike in California, New York counties' systems aren't designed to hold two\ncongressional elections at once, which led to a puzzle that doubled the number\nof ballots required and fueled voter confusion.\n\n\n\nThe special between Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, and Ryan,\nwho has the same title for Ulster County, was especially confusing given that\nthose candidates won't face each other again in the regular general election.\n\n\n\n\"It's just a perfect storm of confusion,\" Czarny said.\n\n\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen current and former candidates, operatives,\nelection scholars, and election officials reveal the promise and potential \u2014\nas well as the costs \u2014 of rising special elections as a pathway to Congress\nfor younger and first-time candidates.\n\n\n\nPreviously overlooked special elections galvanized voters and became national\nbeacons of hope and existential power struggles early on in the Trump era for\nDemocrats, who poured money and time into electing candidates like Ossoff in\nthe Atlanta suburbs, Lamb in western Pennsylvania, and Jones in Alabama.\n\n\n\nA steady churn of special congressional elections, over 40 in the past five\nyears alone, has attracted increasing amounts of national attention and\nskyrocketing levels of campaign spending.\n\n\n\n\"You're seeing just massive amounts of money from other parts of the country\ncoming into these races,\" Owen, the University of West Georgia professor,\nsaid.\n\n\n\nOn the upside, the lack of an entrenched candidate, combined with a truncated\ncampaign timeline, can open doors to candidates who'd otherwise have little\nchance of unseating an incumbent.\n\n\n\nDeb Otis, the research director at FairVote, which advocates for ranked-choice\nvoting, said special elections \"can present a great opportunity for new\ncandidates\" in open seats, especially those who gain national attention.\n\n\n\n\"The prospect of a new person \u2014 even though it was going to be this slightly\nshortened timeline of a special election \u2014 that was very appealing,\" Tricia\nZunker, who ran in a special election for a district in Northern and Central\nWisconsin in spring 2020 as a Democrat, told Insider.\n\n\n\nLourin Hubbard, a 33-year-old water-quality-control manager in California's\nCentral Valley, jumped at the chance to run for Congress when Nunes resigned.\n\n\n\n\"At that point, I was just like, 'Cool, big money is out. Now we can be free\nto talk directly to voters about policy,'\" Hubbard, a Democrat, told Insider\nin an interview.\n\n\n\nThe special-election environment, Owen said, \"actually allows a little bit\nmore of a level playing field for many candidates\" but benefits those with\nname recognition.\n\n\n\nHubbard said the 90-day length of his campaign made it based \"almost purely\"\non name recognition. And Zunker said that while a special election kept her\nmessage from being \"drowned out\" by other candidates and races, the sheer size\nof her district made it challenging to compete financially and on the\nairwaves.\n\n\n\nDan McCready, a businessperson and a Marine Corps veteran, was one of the many\nDemocrats compelled to run for office in the wake of Donald Trump's win in the\n2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\"I saw the direction our country was moving in and really felt a calling to\nserve again like I did in the years after 9\/11,\" McCready, who ran for a\ndistrict outside of Charlotte in Southern North Carolina in 2018, told Insider\nin an interview.\n\n\n\nMcCready lost that race, but officials invalided the election and ordered a\nnew one amid allegations of widespread absentee ballot fraud perpetrated by\nthe winning campaign. (The political consultant accused of masterminding the\nscheme died before he could face trial in the matter). That prompted a special\nelection nearly a year later and put the district in the national spotlight.\n\n\n\n\"I felt like I was just sprinting for three years,\" McCready said.\n\n\n\nMcCready ultimately lost his special election to Republican Dan Bishop but,\nthree years on, views it as a flashpoint in long-running struggles over\ndemocracy.\n\n\n\n\"I see these struggles that we're fighting for so much more as long-term\nstruggles,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEmily Cherniack, the founder and executive director of New Politics, which\nrecruits candidates with service backgrounds to run for office, described\nspecial elections as \"campaigns on speed,\" a dynamic that can hurt upstart\ncandidates.\n\n\n\n\"A special election is not set up for outsiders to be successful. It's low\nturnout, and it's also people who vote all the time, so it is hard for someone\nnew to have any type of runway,\" Cherniack said, adding: \"We do not advocate\nfor our candidates to do special elections unless it's out of necessity.\"\n\n\n\nMcCready's decision to run in a special election was one of those exceptions\nand a stand he took out of principle. But it wasn't easy.\n\n\n\n\"We knew from the beginning that it would be harder to win a special\nelection,\" McCready said of his September 2019 special election. \"Being the\nonly race on the ballot can be a big disadvantage.\"\n\n\n\nBut in the right circumstances, the national environment can help propel\ncandidates to victory.\n\n\n\nRyan, the Ulster County executive, successfully seized on the backlash to\nSupreme Court decisions on abortion and gun restrictions to win the special\nelection to replace now-Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in a battleground district in\nupstate New York.\n\n\n\n\"The energy and the fire and the intensity is really high, similar to what we\nfelt in 2017 and '18,\" Ryan told Insider in an August interview ahead of the\nspecial election.\n\n\n\n\"Democrats have been pulling our punches on these issues for way too long. I\ndon't know why,\" Ryan said of gun violence and abortion. \"It feels like\nleaders of both parties are out of touch and distant from the actual emotion\nthat people are feeling.\"\n\n\n\nRyan and others said that a leader's genuine connection to issues facing\nvoters, and not just their age, determine the quality of their leadership.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes in our politics, we get stuck in the wonk and the talking points,\nand we just lose our humanity,\" Ryan said. \"I think it's more about\ngenerational change and people that are more rooted and connected to where the\nvast majority of Americans are at. The more disconnected you become, the less\npeople trust you.\"\n\n\n\nHubbard from Central Valley, for his part, said he \"would love to see more\nyoung folks run.\"\n\n\n\nHe summed up his and many of his peers' sentiment about California's senior\nsenator: \"I'm sorry, Dianne Feinstein, you have been in office for 52 years.\nYou gave it the good college try to push the ball up the hill. Let's let some\nrelief pitching take over.\"\n\n\n\nResignations and deaths among members of Congress are inevitable. Special\nelections aren't going away.\n\n\n\nBut advocates and candidates say the system could work better for candidates\nand voters.\n\n\n\nCalifornia now allows counties to run elections with fewer countywide voting\nsites instead of traditional precincts, which significantly reduced the number\nof volunteer workers needed, and brought \"a fairly big cost saving\" for\nsmaller elections like specials, Kus said.\n\n\n\nWilliamson, the resident fellow for governance at R Street, and groups such as\nFairVote also advocate for ranked-choice voting to ensure the winners of often\ncrowded special-election primaries get a majority of the vote, a lower-cost\nalternative to expensive runoff elections.\n\n\n\n\"You have an opportunity for finding the maybe not the most popular candidate,\nbut the most agreeable candidate,\" Williamson said of ranked-choice voting.\n\n\n\nAside from structural changes to the US's voting systems, reducing the nonstop\nstream of special elections and lowering their costs would require members of\nCongress to decide to step aside at the end of their terms, instead of hanging\non until the very end.\n\n\n\n\"It's not just the millions of dollars to hold the election but weeks more of\ncampaigning and vitriol,\" Williamson said of special elections. \"And we know\nvoters just get tired of it.\"\n\n\n\nRead next\n\n\n\nListen to The Refresh, Insider's real-time news show\n\n\n\nListen to The Refresh, Insider's real-time news show\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":1,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Photo credit\n\n\n\nA quarter century ago, Tom Peters helped make the term \u201cpersonal branding\u201d\npart of our vocabulary\u2014long before the prevalence of social media, vast\nglobalization, the infusion of millennials and Gen Zs into the workforce and\nthe new WFA (work from anywhere) model. Some of the original tools for\npersonal branding are now museum pieces, but the importance of uncovering,\nexpressing and expanding your personal brand has never before been so vital,\nnot only for individual career success but also for organizations that seek to\ninspire, engage and retain their talent. Here\u2019s how the world of personal\nbranding is being transformed:\n\n\n\n **Today\u2019s workforce demands transparency, authenticity, individuality and\nrecognition**\n\n\n\nMillennials and Gen Z employees want to be recognized for their unique skills\nand talents. The personal brands of your company\u2019s leaders and employees have\na major impact on the organization\u2019s ability to hire, engage and retain top\ntalent. In fact, for millennials who are looking to join your company, the\nbrand of your organization and the brand of its leaders are equally important\n(in terms of recruiting) to the job that is being offered. In the hiring\nprocess, leaders and other team members are being googled. In the war for top\ntalent, it\u2019s essential that the company brand and the brands of your people\nstand out from the competition to attract the best.\n\n\n\n **Your people are now a part of the company brand**\n\n\n\nPersonal branding is no longer reserved just for senior executives or sales\nleaders; it\u2019s for all employees at all levels and in all functions. According\nto Nielsen, only 33% of buyers trust the brand while 90% of customers trust\nproduct or service recommendations from people they know. Your employees can\nhave a major impact on corporate success\u2014way beyond their official job\ndescription. The face of the brand, although managed by the CMO, is no longer\ncentrally controlled. Every employee has a role to play in expressing and\nenhancing the company brand. This new approach, called applied personal\nbranding, begins with helping employees uncover and build their brands,\nfollowed by teaching them to apply their personal brand to the mission of the\ncompany in an authentic way. Consider these statistics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen employees can learn about their brand and understand their role in\nbuilding the corporate brand and, most importantly, when they are empowered to\ndo so, they can impact corporate success far beyond their assigned role. As a\nbonus, they stay engaged even outside their job function and division, and\nthey are more aware of what\u2019s going on in the organization at a higher level.\n\n\n\n **WFA enhances the need for personal branding**\n\n\n\nThe new post-Covid hybrid work model, Work From Anywhere, means remote work\nwill be a major part of the work environment. That presents new challenges for\nbeing visible and demonstrating value to key stakeholders. Out of sight, out\nof mind means it\u2019s now essential to take daily deliberate action to stay top\nof mind no matter where you are. Brand building needs to take priority on your\nDo-list.\n\n\n\n **Digital branding precedes real branding**\n\n\n\nEven for companies with robust intranets, employees are using Google and\nLinkedIn to learn about colleagues and leaders. Employees who work remotely\ndon\u2019t get to share their brand in the coffee room or at the water cooler.\nTherefore, the digital version of remote employees\u2019 brands must be authentic,\ncompelling and magnetic for teams to be able to build trust and engage fully.\nWe learned that lesson when social media first arose. Branding has moved\nonline. As identified by Mitch Joel in the book _Ctrl Alt Delete_, people\nlearn about companies and individuals online before ever engaging in person\n(if they engage in person at all . . . that\u2019s no longer essential). The\nimplications of this Digital First phenomenon are vast for talent development\ninitiatives.\n\n\n\nPersonal branding has evolved tremendously over the last quarter century, with\nthe most significant changes emerging after the onset of the pandemic. It\u2019s\ntime to take a look at your brand and personal brand action plan to make sure\nyou\u2019re relevant in this new environment.\n\n\n\n _William Arruda is a_ _keynote speaker_ _, co-founder of_ _CareerBlast.TV_\n_and co-creator of the_ _Personal Brand Power Audit_ _\\- a complimentary quiz\nthat helps you measure the strength of personal brand._\n\n\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"FRANKFURT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) on Monday said markets\nwere too jittery for a fast listing of its hydrogen division Nucera,\nconfirming that an initial public offering (IPO) for the business was still\nthe favoured scenario.\n\n\n\n\"Even though we currently consider the capital market environment to be rather\nunfavourable for a quick IPO, an IPO of tk nucera remains the preferred\noption,\" the company said when asked about whether conditions had changed in\nthe wake of the planned IPO of Porsche.\n\n\n\n\"We continue to monitor developments closely.\"\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n\n\nA look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.\n\n\n\nReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world\u2019s\nlargest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every\nday.

The probes, said a\nGOP member of Congress and multiple Republican operatives who requested\nanonymity to discuss plans that have yet to be made public, will marry\nRepublicans\u2019 newly formed hostility to the Chamber with the party\u2019s mission to\nundermine the growth of the ESG investment sector.\n\n\n\nThe power of ESG \u2014 which stands for environmental, social, and governance \u2014\ncriteria to shape company valuations and behavior has become a major source of\nconsternation among conservatives, who argue that companies that follow it are\nbreaking with their fiduciary duty to maximize profits for investors.\n\n\n\nThe Chamber has infuriated Republicans by endorsing ESG criteria. \u201cToday, for\nmany companies, climate change and carbon emissions impact long-term value,\nthereby becoming a factor that retirement fund managers should take into\nconsideration,\u201d wrote a Chamber vice president in a typical statement in July\n2020.\n\n\n\nThe congressman highlighted what he saw as the downfalls of that approach.\nRepublicans accuse ESG advocates of using ESG criteria to punish American\nenergy companies, only to then give an advantage to large, foreign energy\ncompanies over which the U.S. has little oversight anyways.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow is it again that you can discourage investment in American energy when\nyou own, or when you\u2019re controlling board seats, of an American energy\ncompany, but you\u2019re pushing it offshore to a Chinese energy company? Tell me\nyou didn\u2019t violate your fiduciary duty somehow,\u201d said the congressman. \u201cThen\nyou throw that over into Judiciary [Committee hearings] and say, how do you\nreconcile this from an antitrust perspective? How can somebody actually be\nduty-of-care to the shareholders of one entity when you\u2019re duty-of-care to the\nChinese Communist Party\u2019s-controlled energy company?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is not going to be much to investigate,\u201d said a Chamber spokesperson.\n\u201cThe Chamber is at the forefront of fighting the SEC climate, human capital\nand similar disclosures and believes fiduciaries must focus on maximizing\nreturn.\u201d House Republicans, though, think the Chamber is having it both ways,\ncriticizing the Securities and Exchange Commission rule but supporting the\nprinciple. \u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports climate policy that includes\nthe disclosure of material information for investors to use,\u201d reads the\nChamber\u2019s comment on the SEC\u2019s proposed rule changes that would increase\ndisclosure requirements for ESG funds.\n\n\n\nThe growth of the ESG industry has led to some counterintuitive results, as\ncompanies have learned to game the metrics: Some private prison companies, for\ninstance, score well on the criteria.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, 14 state treasurers issued a joint statement condemning\nRepublican efforts to combat investor advocacy, which has led multiple states,\nincluding West Virginia, Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, and Florida, to restrict\nstate treasurers from doing business with funds that deploy ESG screens.\n\n\n\n\u201cDisclosure, transparency, and accountability make companies more resilient by\nsharpening how they manage, ensuring that they are appropriately planning for\nthe future. Our work, alongside those of other investors, employees, and\ncustomers have caused many companies to evolve their business models and their\ninternal processes, better addressing the long term material risks that\nthreaten their performance,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe evolving divide\nsuggests that there will be two kinds of states moving forward: states focused\non short term gains and states focused on long term beneficial outcomes for\nall stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chamber announced recently it would devote $3 million toward the election\nof Mehmet Oz \u2014 who goes by Dr. Oz \u2014 in Pennsylvania, and funneled it through\nthe Senate Leadership Fund. The move was generally seen as an olive branch to\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is linked to the super PAC.\nThey have so far made no similar contribution to the House Republican super\nPAC.\n\n\n\n _Today\u2019s GOP war_ on the Chamber of Commerce represents a stunning turnaround\nfrom just a few years ago, when House Republicans and the Chamber were aligned\non just about everything. And it comes in the wake of the collapse of the\nNational Rifle Association, leaving two of the GOP\u2019s most powerful outside\narmies largely disarmed. But as the Republican Party and the Chamber have\npolarized to opposite sides of the conservative movement, a deeper\ndisagreement between the two \u2014 dating back to the movement that formed around\nBarry Goldwater in the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 has been reawakened.\n\n\n\nAt the height of the New Deal era after World War II, Democrats and liberal\nRepublicans were united in the belief that cooperation between big business,\nbig labor, and government was the secret to the era\u2019s economic boom. John\nKenneth Galbraith, the nation\u2019s most famous economist and later President John\nF. Kennedy\u2019s adviser, dubbed it \u201cThe Affluent Society\u201d in a 1958 book that was\nboth a cultural and a political sensation.\n\n\n\nArrayed against this coalition was an aggrieved and increasingly well-\norganized network of small and medium-sized businesses that felt they were\ngetting squeezed by the big guys. What was good for General Motors, they said,\nwas not necessarily good for them.\n\n\n\nBig Labor and the New Deal coalition thought that they were living in a time\nof peace between capital and labor, but capital always knew that they were\nengaged in a strategic ceasefire, having been crushed by the Depression and\nunable to compete against the rising strength of the modern government.\n\n\n\nBut there was no real peace, and big business launched its counterattack on\nboth labor and government in the 1970s, ushering in the neoliberal era. The\nChamber, this time allied with small and medium-sized businesses, played a\nmajor role in the counterattack, with the heir to the Goldwater movement,\nRonald Reagan, enacting a wish list of big business policies, deregulation,\nand tax cuts.\n\n\n\nJamie Galbraith, who followed his father into the economics profession, served\nas an aide to the Joint Tax Committee in Congress and recalled the Chamber at\nthe time as an \u201cultra supply-side, ultra Reagan revolution organization with\nessentially no compromisers. \u2026 The Chamber was just down-the-line for the\nlowest possible taxes and most complete deregulation and privatization.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the Chamber started drifting back to the center in the early part of the\nClinton years, endorsing the administration\u2019s health care proposal known as\n\u201cHillarycare,\u201d for the first lady. \u201cAll of a sudden, the Chamber just became\nsomething wholly different than whatever I perceived them to be. And I know we\nwere very upset about it,\u201d said former Texas Rep. Dick Armey, the No. 3\nRepublican at the time.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the endorsement, recalled one Republican operative, a member of\nHouse Republican leadership asked to meet with the Chamber\u2019s board. Instead of\ndelivering a standard political speech, he began by asking all the staff to\nleave the room. \u201cHe just ripped them a new asshole,\u201d said the operative. \u201cHow\ncould you possibly go down this anti-free enterprise, left-wing trail,\u201d the\nGOP leader demanded. (The operative recalled it was Armey, but Armey said it\nmay have been Tom DeLay. I couldn\u2019t track down DeLay in time for this story.)\n\n\n\nThe dressing down worked. Richard Lesher had run the organization since 1975,\nbut after Republicans took power in 1995 after the Gingrich Revolution in\n1995, Lesher was eased out. \u201cWhen we took the majority, of course, they came\nover, reminding us that we were the best friends we ever had \u2014 yakety yak,\u201d\nArmey said. \u201cWhen you come into the majority, you have no shortage of newfound\nfriends.\u201d The Chamber was a reliable Republican ally for the next roughly 20\nyears, up until just the last few.\n\n\n\n(DeLay later launched what he dubbed the K Street Project, which was an effort\nto bring all of Washington\u2019s lobbying industry under Republican authority,\ndictating that firms fire Democratic lobbyists or lose access to the GOP.\n\u201cThat was a boneheaded idea, and you can quote me if you like. I mean, who in\nthe hell did he think he was, telling people who they can hire and who they\ncan\u2019t?\u201d said Armey. \u201cI objected to it in a leadership meeting. And my\nobjections were not well received.\u201d)\n\n\n\nThe tensions between big and little businesses never fully subsided, and the\nsame network of smaller businesses that aligned themselves with Goldwater,\nforming the more conservative wing of the GOP, organizing behind Donald Trump\nin 2016 and beyond. The small and medium-sized businesses, particularly\nmanufacturers, have also long been opposed to free-trade policies, as they\nlack the capacity to offshore their own production and can\u2019t compete with\ncheaper products from overseas.\n\n\n\nThe conservative Republican member of Congress said that he didn\u2019t begin as an\nactive opponent of the Chamber, but didn\u2019t see them as a natural ally either.\n\u201cFrankly, as a business guy, I couldn\u2019t join some of the efforts nationally,\nbecause they were at odds with small companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were really\npushing for a long time this pro-China trade policy, which was great for\nGeneral Motors, but it was bad for everyone in the supply chain. And it was\nreally gutting domestic manufacturing. And it was the same with NAM\u201d \u2014 the\nNational Association of Manufacturers \u2014 \u201ca lot of their members had had an\norganization that was working against their interests. And the biggest,\nbiggest members have certainly benefited from a lot of this stuff. And I think\nthat\u2019s a big part of why Trump was so well received by the small and medium\nbusiness community.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chamber is among the biggest spenders on lobbying activities in the\ncountry, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and leading\nSenate Republicans like John Cornyn of Texas regularly take public shots at\nthem. The Chamber\u2019s top lobbying job, typically one of Washington\u2019s plummest K\nStreet assignments, sat open for several months until it was filled by two-\nterm, back-bench former Rep. Evan Jenkins, who, like many Republicans from\nWest Virginia, began his career as a Democrat. He was most recently a judge in\nWest Virginia, having left the House to pursue an unsuccessful run for Senate\nin 2018.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the Chamber endorsed 23 House Democrats in swing districts, a sharp\nbreak from the past practice of endorsing a nearly exclusive slate of\nRepublicans, with one or two Democrats thrown on the list for a patina of\nbipartisan perception. The pivot came after the Chamber had been unsuccessful\nin stopping Trump from getting the 2016 GOP nomination \u2014 with a top Chamber\nlobbyist even endorsing Hillary Clinton and speaking at the Democratic\nNational Convention. The business group delighted in Trump\u2019s tax cut, largely\nwritten by Chamber ally Speaker Paul Ryan, but once Democrats took control in\n2018, the Chamber began hedging its political bets by backing moderate\nDemocrats.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Chamber of Commerce, after what they did in 2020, they basically became\npersona non grata in the conservative movement,\u201d said one well-connected\nRepublican operative. \u201cThere was already a split in the conservative movement,\nwho were never fans of the Chamber, but you had more moderate members and even\nthose Republicans, particularly the ones in the House, have had enough of the\nChamber.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a group that has less influence over Republican members of\nCongress at this point than the Chamber of Commerce,\u201d the operative, who asked\nfor anonymity due to their work on political campaigns in which the Chamber\ngets involved, added. \u201cThat certainly wasn\u2019t the case a few years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat the Chamber feels at home in the Democratic Party ought to be cause for\nconcern for the party\u2019s progressive wing, Galbraith said. \u201cThe extirpation of\nany old line liberalism in the Democratic Party may have opened up space for\nthem,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nRyan Grim[email protected]\u200btheintercept.com@ryangrim\n\n\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy\nPolicy and Terms of Use.\n\n\n\nFetching more\n\n","ESG_RELEVANT":0,"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR":"Impact on local communities","SCALE":"Severe","NATURE_OF_HARM":"Serious","PILLAR":"Social","SUB_PILLAR":"Customers","INVOLVED":"Direct","STATUS":"Ongoing","COMPANY_NAME":"RSS","CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT":"Severe","FLAG":"Orange","FLAG_SCORE":1.0,"name":"RSS"},{"News":"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps\nmillions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts,\nbooks, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps\nmillions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts,\nbooks, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.\n\n\n\nThe best index funds can help you build wealth by diversifying your portfolio\nwhile minimizing your fees. Investing in an index fund is less risky than\ninvesting in individual stocks or bonds because index funds often hold\nhundreds of securities. Index funds spread your investment risk across the\nstocks or bonds of many different individual companies.\n\n\n\nIndex funds hold baskets of investments to track a market index, such as the\n**S &P 500** (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Index funds are passively managed, meaning\nthat the fund's holdings are entirely determined by the index the fund tracks.\nThe goal of an index fund is to match the performance of the underlying index.\nThey're a good choice for long-term investors because you can lock in the\nreturns of the overall stock market or a specific segment of it.\n\n\n\nThe returns generated by an index fund generally never exceed the performance\nof the index itself, if only because of index fund expense ratios, which are\nthe annual management fees collected by index fund managers. Since index funds\nare passively managed, they are actually more likely over the long term to\noutperform funds with active managers.\n\n\n\nAn index fund can either be a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nInvestors buy shares of mutual funds directly from asset management companies;\nshares in ETFs are purchased and sold through stock exchanges.\n\n\n\nConsider these key factors when picking an index fund:\n\n\n\nOur picks for the nine best index funds for 2022 can help you accomplish a\nvariety of investment goals. Plus, they have low expense ratios and low\nminimum investments.\n\n\n\nBecause 2022 has been a tough year for stocks, many of the funds listed below\nare down so far this year. But remember: Index investing is about building\nwealth for the long haul. Don't let short-term volatility deter you from\ngetting started.\n\n\n\nInvesting in S&P 500 index funds is perhaps the closest thing to a guaranteed\nway to build wealth over time. The **Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund**\n(NASDAQMUTFUND:FNILX), which tracks an index of just over 500 U.S. large-cap\nstocks, performs very similarly to an S&P 500 index fund. But because this\nfund is not an official S&P 500 index fund, it avoids paying expensive\nlicensing fees to **S &P Global** (NYSE:SPGI), the index's parent company. The\nfund tracks the **Fidelity U.S. Large Cap Index** as its benchmark.\n\n\n\nThe \"ZERO\" in the fund's name denotes that the expense ratio for this fund is\n0%. There's also no minimum investment amount, making the fund a good choice\nfor beginning investors.\n\n\n\nThe fund moves in near-lockstep with the S&P 500. Total returns since its\ninception in September 2018 were 43.4% as of mid-May 2022, just shy of the S&P\n500's return of 44.2% during the same period. In early 2022, the fund was down\nabout 18%, slightly more than the S&P 500.\n\n\n\nIf you want to invest in an official S&P 500 index fund, then the **Schwab S\n&P 500 Index Fund** (NASDAQMUTFUND:SWPPX) is about the cheapest you'll find.\nIts expense ratio is 0.02%, meaning you'd annually pay just $0.20 for every\n$1,000 you invest. Because this investment fee is so low, your returns are\nvirtually identical to the performance of the S&P 500.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, the fund's year-to-date total returns of 31.43% were almost identical\nto the S&P 500's. By May 2022, both the fund and the S&P 500 were down about\n16% for the year to date. There's no minimum investment amount, so you can\nstart investing with as little as $1.\n\n\n\nIf you want to assume more investment risk in the pursuit of higher rewards,\nthen the **Vanguard Growth ETF** (NYSEMKT:VUG) is a solid choice. The fund\ntracks the **CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index** , which performs similarly to\nthe **S &P 500 Growth Index.** This ETF invests in 266 U.S. large-cap growth\nstocks.\n\n\n\nTech stocks are heavily represented, accounting for 49.7% of the fund's\nholdings, followed by consumer discretionary stocks (24%) and industrial\nstocks (10.3%). Energy stocks and utility stocks combined make up only 0.9% of\nthe fund's value.\n\n\n\nThis ETF has a minuscule 0.04% expense ratio. As of Dec. 31, 2021, the fund's\naverage annual return over five years (before taxes) was 24.78%, easily\nbeating the S&P 500 over that period.\n\n\n\nHowever, as tech stocks continue to nosedive in 2022, the fund was down\nthrough May by around 28% -- significantly more than the S&P 500. Still,\ninvesting in Vanguard's Growth ETF could present an opportunity to buy the\ndip.\n\n\n\nA top index fund for income-oriented investors is the **SPDR S &P Dividend ETF\n**(NYSEMKT:SDY). The dividend-weighted fund's benchmark is the **S &P High\nYield Dividend Aristocrats Index**, which tracks 119 of the stocks in the **S\n&P Composite 1500** **Index** with the highest dividend yields. All of the\ncompanies owned by this ETF have increased their dividend payments annually\nfor at least 25 consecutive years.\n\n\n\nDividend-paying stocks tend to be less volatile compared to the overall stock\nmarket. So it isn't surprising that the SPDR S&P 500 Dividend ETF was down\njust over 3% for the year through May, significantly less than the S&P 500.\n\n\n\nThe fund's 12-month dividend yield as of May 2022, was 2.71% -- well above the\nS&P 500's 1.46%. The expense ratio is also somewhat higher at 0.35%.\n\n\n\nThe fund's top five holdings are manufacturing corporation **Leggett & Platt\nInc.** (NYSE:LEG), **IBM** (NYSE:IBM), global packaging company **Amcor PLC**\n(NYSE:AMCR), **ExxonMobil** (NYSE:XOM), and **National Retail Properties**\n(NYSE:NNN), a real estate investment trust (REIT). Several REITs, which\ntypically pay high dividends because they're required to disburse at least 90%\nof their taxable incomes, are included in the fund. The ETF is underweighted\nin tech stocks, which don't tend to pay generous dividends.\n\n\n\nIf you want to invest across the real estate market, the **Vanguard Real\nEstate ETF** (NYSEMKT:VNQ) is a solid, low-cost option. With an expense ratio\nof 0.12%, it's also by far the largest real estate index fund, with about\n$86.3% billion of assets under management.\n\n\n\nIts benchmark index is the **MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25\/50\nIndex** , which broadly tracks the U.S. real estate market. Although the index\nincludes a few real estate management and development companies, it consists\nmostly of equity REITs, which own and operate income-producing real estate.\n\n\n\nBecause it invests primarily in REITs, the ETF is also attractive to dividend\ninvestors. The fund's 12-month dividend yield as of May 2022 was 2.45%. The\nVanguard ETF may also appeal to investors concerned about inflation since real\nestate is traditionally seen as an inflation hedge.\n\n\n\nBrowse top ETF brokerages\n\n\n\nThe **Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF** (NASDAQ:VTWO), which tracks the **Russell\n2000** (RUSSELLINDICES:^RUT), is a good place to start for investors who want\nto take advantage of the potential upside of investing in small-cap companies.\nThe fund invests in 2,032 small- and mid-cap companies that have a median\nmarket capitalization of $2.9 billion.\n\n\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the index fund's largest concentration was in healthcare\n(16.1%), financials (15.9%), and industrials (15.4%). The fund's expense\nratio, at 0.1%, is relatively low, especially for one that offers exposure to\nthe companies with the most growth potential.\n\n\n\nLike its benchmark index, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF underperformed the S&P\n500 during the first five months of 2022, declining about 20%.\n\n\n\nThematic investors who want to capitalize on a long-term secular trend should\ncheck out the **VanEck Semiconductor ETF** (NASDAQ:SMH). The index fund tracks\nthe **MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index** , which tracks 25 domestic and\ninternational companies that produce semiconductors and related equipment. It\nhas $7.8 billion in total net assets and an expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\n\n\nIt has been a rocky 2022 for semiconductor stocks amid ongoing chip shortages,\na broader tech sell-off, and a shortage of skilled workers. But plenty of\ntrends point to a bright future for the industry. These include the shift to\nelectric vehicles and 5G mobile technology and a continued surge in cloud-\nbased solutions.\n\n\n\nWith supply chain woes expected to persist for some time, the VanEck\nSemiconductor ETF is only appropriate for investors with a long time horizon\nand a relatively high risk tolerance. As of mid-May 2022, the fund was down\nabout 25%. But, with the semiconductor market projected to almost double by\n2030, buying this index fund in a bear market could be a smart play for long-\nterm investors.\n\n\n\nIf you're seeking portfolio exposure to high-growth emerging markets but don't\nwant your risk concentrated in a single economy or region, the **Schwab\nEmerging Markets Equity ETF** (NYSEMKT:SCHE) may be a good fit. It tracks the\nFTSE Emerging Index, a collection of large- and mid-cap stocks in more than 20\ndeveloping countries. The fund has 1,843 holdings, with the largest\nconcentrations in China, Taiwan, India, Brazil, and South Africa. Its expense\nratio is only 0.11%.\n\n\n\nThe stocks of companies in emerging markets have historically underperformed\ncompared to U.S. stocks. Between 2012 and 2021, the Schwab emerging market\nfunds, on a combined basis, had total returns of about 67%. The S&P 500,\nmeanwhile, racked up total returns of more than 350%. Considering that about\n85% of the world's population lives in developing countries, investors with a\nlong-term focus who are comfortable with volatility may want to seriously\nconsider investing in this fund.\n\n\n\nInvestors who are interested in sustainable investing should check out the\n**Fidelity U.S. Sustainability Index Fund** (NASDAQMUTFUND:FITL.X). The fund's\nbenchmark is the MSCI USA ESG Leaders Index, which tracks the performances of\nlarge- and mid-cap domestic stocks with above-average ESG ratings. The index\nfund has a low expense ratio of 0.11% and no minimum investment amount.\n\n\n\nThe fund's largest concentrations as of March 31, 2022, are in the technology\n(28.6%), healthcare (13.5%), and consumer discretionary (12.8%) sectors. This\nsustainability ETF's top holdings are **Microsoft** (NASDAQ:MSFT), **Tesla**\n(NASDAQ:TSLA), Google parent **Alphabet** (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL),\n**Nvidia** (NASDAQ:NVDA), and **Johnson & Johnson** (NYSE:JNJ).\n\n\n\nAlthough ESG funds are appealing to those who want to invest with a\nconscience, a strong ESG focus is also good for returns. Companies that pose\nlittle ESG-related risk often deliver superior financial performance, making\nESG funds such as the Fidelity U.S. Sustainability Index Fund a good choice\nfor long-term investors.\n\n\n\nSome index funds track the S&P 500.

The Porgera mine has\nproduced billions of dollars of gold in its twenty years of operation, and is\noperated and 95 percent owned by Barrick Gold, a Canadian company that is the\nworld's largest gold producer.\n\n\n\nThe 94-page report, \"Gold's Costly Dividend: Human Rights Impacts of Papua New\nGuinea's Porgera Gold Mine,\" identifies systemic failures on the part of\nToronto-based Barrick Gold that kept the company from recognizing the risk of\nabuses, and responding to allegations that abuses had occurred. The report\nexamines the impact of Canada's failure to regulate the overseas activities of\nits companies and also calls on Barrick to address environmental and health\nconcerns around the mine with greater transparency.\n\n\n\n\"We interviewed women who described brutal gang rapes by security guards at\nBarrick's mine,\" said Chris Albin-Lackey, senior business and human rights\nresearcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The company should have acted long before\nHuman Rights Watch conducted its research and prompted them into action\".\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that in response to its investigation, Barrick has\ntaken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for\nsimilar abuses to occur in future.\n\n\n\nMost of the world's mining and exploration companies are based in Canada. But\nCanada's government has not exercised meaningful oversight or regulation of\nthe overseas operations of Canadian companies, Human Rights Watch said. Bill\nC-300, a modest but important effort to impose greater government oversight,\nwas defeated in Canada's House of Commons in October 2010. Barrick had lobbied\nvigorously against the measure.\n\n\n\n\"Canada's government is asleep at the wheel,\" Albin-Lackey said. \"And if\nBarrick wants to hold itself out as a responsible corporate citizen, it should\nsupport meaningful government oversight and regulation of Canadian companies.\"\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea's sprawling Porgera gold mine has produced more than 16\nmillion ounces of gold since opening in 1990 - an amount that would be worth\nmore than US$20 billion at today's prices. In 2010, Barrick's worldwide\noperations were on track to produce more than 7.5 million ounces of gold, an\namount worth more than $9.7 billion at current prices.\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea has an abundance of natural resources, but poor governance\nand corruption have prevented this wealth from benefitting ordinary citizens.\nThe government has failed to bring economic opportunity or deliver basic\ngovernment services to Porgera, and the region is mired in poverty and\nviolence.\n\n\n\nBarrick maintains a private security force of nearly 450 personnel at Porgera.\nThe mine must cope with extraordinary security challenges, including violent\nraids by groups of illegal miners. But Human Rights Watch research documents\nopportunistic, violent abuses allegedly committed by some security force\nmembers that are in no way a reaction to these threats.\n\n\n\nEvery day, hundreds of people try to eke out a living by scouring the waste\nrock dumps around the mine for minute traces of gold. In contrast to the\nparticipants in violent raids that the mine confronts on a regular basis,\nthese miners are for the most part engaged in an entirely nonviolent - albeit\nunauthorized - practice. They face arrest by company security officers if they\nare caught on the waste dumps.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch investigated six alleged incidents of gang rape by company\nsecurity personnel. In each case, women were allegedly raped after being\ncaptured by company security personnel on the waste dumps. The women\ninterviewed by Human Rights Watch described scenes of extreme violence. One\ndescribed being gang raped by six security personnel after one of her\nassailants kicked her in the face and shattered her teeth. Human Rights Watch\nalso documented cases of people who alleged that they were beaten or otherwise\nmistreated by guards who apprehended them on the waste dumps.\n\n\n\nNone of the women interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they had reported the\nalleged rapes to the local authorities or to the company. Some said their\nassailants had told them they would be arrested if they tried to complain.\nCompounding matters, Barrick did not have any safe channels of communication\nthat community members could use to report abuses.\n\n\n\nBarrick has responded with appropriate vigor to the allegations brought\nforward by Human Rights Watch. The company opened a major internal\ninvestigation, facilitated a criminal investigation by the Papua New Guinea\npolice, and made a commitment to take steps that could strengthen oversight\nand accountability for the security force at Porgera.\n\n\n\nThe alleged gang rapes appear to be part of a wider pattern, Human Rights\nWatch said. The company and police investigations that followed the Human\nRights Watch disclosures have uncovered other cases of alleged sexual\nviolence.\n\n\n\nIn a public statement, Barrick called the results of its internal\ninvestigation \"disturbing\" and announced the termination of several security\npersonnel for involvement in, or failure to report, alleged incidents of\nsexual violence. Police arrested three current and former Porgera Joint\nVenture employees in January, 2011. Two were charged with rape and the third\nwith inflicting grievous bodily harm.\n\n\n\nA January 17 police statement predicted that more charges were likely to flow\nfrom their investigation and said that the arrests should serve as a warning\nthat serious abuses will not be tolerated. That message is important but it\nwill take work to convince many people to believe it, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Papua New Guinea police force are regularly implicated in\nincidents of torture and rape, and the force's abusive reputation makes the\npublic reluctant to turn to it for help. If the government wants to combat\nimpunity for rape and other serious crimes, it will have to start by ensuring\nthat the police themselves are held accountable for their conduct, Human\nRights Watch said.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch's research also examines concerns about the health and\nenvironmental impacts of the Porgera mine. The mine dumps 16,000 tons of\nliquid waste into the nearby Porgera River every day. This controversial\npractice is out of line with current industry standards, and critics worry\nthat it could pose health risks to communities far downstream.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch called on Barrick to publish several specific sources of\nrelevant data to allow for independent evaluation of the company's claims. The\ncompany has now agreed to make public its annual environmental reports for the\nfirst time. This is a good first step, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch also called for the Papua New Guinea government and\ninternational donors to facilitate a public health survey of possible mercury\npoisoning around Porgera. Impoverished small-scale and illegal miners in the\narea regularly process gold ore by combining it with mercury and then burning\nthe combined materials over an open flame. This is an extremely dangerous\npractice and one that local medical professionals believe may have given rise\nto an untreated epidemic of mercury poisoning in local communities.\n\n\n\nUnion Busting in Cambodia\u2019s Garment and Tourism Sectors\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Impacts of a China Belt and Road Project in Cambodia\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook Share this via Twitter Share this via WhatsApp Share\nthis via Email Other ways to share Share this via LinkedIn Share this via\nReddit Share this via Telegram Share this via Printer\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide,\nspotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.

Critics say the\nPorgera mine has polluted the water supply and created other environmental and\nsocial problems, with minimal economic returns for locals.\n\n\n\nSeven people have died at the Porgera mine since September, including three\nso-called illegal miners last month in clashes that prompted Barrick\u2019s local\nentity to appeal for government intervention.\n\n\n\nBarrick hopes to boost the mine\u2019s production by 18% or more. This previously\nunreported outlook raises the stakes for Prime Minister James Marape\u2019s\ngovernment, which has been seeking richer terms from miners and oil and gas\nproducers.\n\n\n\nThe head of the country\u2019s mining regulator said Barrick, the world\u2019s No. 2\ngold miner, is waiting to begin serious negotiations for permit renewal terms\nwith the country\u2019s executive council, led by Marape.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we can renew the permit on a reasonable basis, it stands up as a tier one\nasset,\u201d Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow told Reuters, referring\nto a large scale, long-life, high margin deposit.\n\n\n\nPNG\u2019s next steps with Barrick could influence billions of dollars of planned\ninvestment by global miners including Australia\u2019s Newcrest Mining and St\nBarbara, who are eyeing new mines or mine extensions, but are wary of rising\nsovereign risk.\n\n\n\nMiners, facing a dearth of new deposits and rising resource nationalism, may\nnow have to cede greater rewards to other stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will have to be equitable sharing of the spoils or these things won\u2019t\nbe developed or will be discontinued, ultimately,\u201d said portfolio manager\nSimon Mawhinney, at Allan Gray in Sydney who is among Newcrest\u2019s biggest\ninvestors.\n\n\n\nBarrick\u2019s tier-one designation, used describe a mine capable of producing\n500,000 ounces of gold annually for at least 10 years at low cost, would place\nPorgera in league with Barrick\u2019s crown jewel assets at a time major gold\nminers are desperate to replace shrinking reserves.\n\n\n\nBarrick and Zijin\u2019s combined 2018 production at Porgera was around 421,500\nounces.\n\n\n\nBarrick has broadened the role of its top China executive and former U.S.\ndiplomat Woo Lee to handle day-to-day talks with the PNG government. It has\npledged to relocate villagers whose land the mine has swallowed and study ways\nto improve management of mine waste currently dumped in rivers, Bristow said.\n\n\n\nThe moves, aimed at mollifying concerns over access to arable land and\npollution of local waterways, may not be enough to satisfy landowners and the\nPNG government who want a larger equity stake.\n\n\n\nBarrick and Zijin each own 47.5% of the mine, with the remaining 5% held by\nlandowner group, Mineral Resources Enga.\n\n\n\nAnalysts have said Barrick could opt to put its stake on the block with other\nassets it has shed to meet a $1.5 billion divestment target. But Bristow\nplayed down a potential sale, saying Porgera fits Barrick\u2019s investment\ncriteria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt makes real returns, it creates value, it can survive the cyclicality of\nthe gold industry and will make a significant contribution to our other\nstakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBarrick\u2019s top executive has shown he is willing to make concessions to settle\ndisputes. In October, Barrick agreed to sell Tanzania a 16% stake in each of\nits Bulyanhulu, North Mara and Buzwagi mines to resolve a long-running fight\nover taxes.\n\n\n\nThe Canadian miner may face added pressure to confront issues in PNG that run\nafoul of investor benchmarks on environmental, social and governance issues.\n\n\n\nStandard Chartered for example has said it will not provide financial services\ndirectly towards mining operations that conduct direct marine or riverine\ntailings disposal.\n\n\n\nMaso Mangape of the Porgera Land Owners Association said local residents had\nbeen squeezed out. \u201cThe mine site has now become a battlefield,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nReporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne and Jeff Lewis in Toronto; Editing by\nDenny Thomas, David Gregorio and Grant McCool\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

If you don't see it, please check your junk\nfolder.\n\n\n\nThe next issue of FP Energy will soon be in your inbox.\n\n\n\nWe encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, mercury and other contaminants were detected in the\nriver system next to the mine, located at high elevation in northwestern\nArgentina, near the border with Chile. The mine, which uses heap leach\nprocessing in which ore is piled on a concrete pad and rinsed with cyanide to\nextract gold and silver, was linked to three spills and Barrick paid millions\nof dollars in fines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards, the spills appeared to stop. But in June the Financial Post\nreported that members of nearby communities and local journalists leveled\naccusations of new spills of mercury and other heavy metals into local waters,\nin 2021 and 2022, citing data collected by scientists at a university in\nMendoza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN special rapporteurs\u2019 letter to Barrick characterized the accusations as\n\u201csufficiently reliable\u201d and expressed concern about the impacts on the local\npopulation\u2019s health and to the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we wish\nto express our grave concern about the impact on human rights caused by spills\nof cyanide, arsenic, mercury and other hazardous substances from the Veladero\nmine,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe lack of effective response by your company\nexacerbates these impacts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is signed by Marcos Orellana, a UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and\nhazardous substances and wastes; Fernanda Hopenhaym, chair-rapporteur of the\nWorking Group on Human Rights and Transnational Corporations; and David Boyd,\nUN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, who is also a\nprofessor at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters were also sent to Shandong Gold, which purchased a 50 per cent stake\nin the mine in 2017 for US$960 million, to the Chinese government, and to the\njoint venture company, Minera Argentina Gold SRL, that operates the mine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN releases letters 60 days after receipt but Barrick provided the\nFinancial Post with a copy of its response, which denies nearly all the\nallegations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company said in its reply that it did not spill any contaminants into the\nenvironment in 2022, and added that the impacts of three historical spills\nwere overstated because they \u201cdid not impact the environment or human rights.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt added that mercury and other metals found in local waters \u201cnaturally occur\nin the region,\u201d and noted that cyanide \u2014 which it uses to rinse ore \u2014 was not\nfound in the water. The company also said it rejects accusations that it did\nnot effectively communicate the previous spills to authorities and local\ncommunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Sa\u00fal Zeballos, who lives in San Jos\u00e9 de J\u00e1chal, a community of 21,000\nabout 200 kilometres downstream from the mine, said he blames Barrick for\nbreaking its promises to protect the local water supply. He added the company\nhas not met local expectations of providing jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nZeballos said Barrick never alerted the community to the original spill in\n2015, which he only heard about informally through connections in the\ncommunity. Since then, everyone has been drinking bottled water, but continue\nto use the local water for cooking and washing despite concerns about the\nhealth impacts, especially for their children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey need to leave and leave the area in the same condition as when they got\nhere\n\n\n\n\u201cThey need to stop polluting the area,\u201d Zeballos said in an interview during\nwhich his comments were translated from Spanish by two translators provided by\nEarthworks and MiningWatch Canada. \u201cThey need to leave and leave the area in\nthe same condition as when they got here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrick initially developed the Veladero mine in 2005. Within several years,\nit started building a second mine several kilometres away, straddling the\nArgentina-Chile border, known as Pascua-Lama. But in 2017, Chilean regulators\nordered Barrick to halt all mining after finding adverse impacts on the\nenvironment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Argentina has passed legislation that says a mine that commits\nthree environmental infractions can be forced to close.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN advisors\u2019 letter to Barrick cites \u201cinformation\u201d it received from\nunnamed sources summarizing four spills linked to Veladero between 2015 and\n2022:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter to Barrick does not address whether any regulators or government\nofficials in Argentina are taking any action at present. It says the impacts\non local communities\u2019 health were a serious concern; it also notes concern\nabout the impact on the local environment, including the San Guillermo\nBiosphere Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are also concerned about the company\u2019s failure to report these spills in a\ntimely manner,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe lack of timely information hinders the\nadoption of protective measures for the populations exposed to toxic\nsubstances in the spills and the environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n(ESG) is skewed towards environmental concerns at the expense of social and\ngovernance\n\n\n\nLast year, the mine produced 172,000 ounces of gold. In October 2021, Barrick\nannounced it would create a trust fund for community development projects near\nthe mine, financed by 1.5 per cent of all gold sales from Veladero.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, on a third quarter earnings call with analysts, Barrick chief\nexecutive Mark Bristow said the company had recently built new pads for its\nheap leach operations and alluded to some difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are still getting our heads around the geomet and leach dynamics, which we\nbelieve have also been exacerbated by the abnormally long winter and freezing\nof part of the pads,\u201d he said, without offering further details.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeating a message he has emphasized previously, Bristow also said on the\ncall that he believes that ESG \u2014 the catch-all term to evaluate a company\u2019s\nenvironmental, social and governance track record \u2014 \u201cis skewed towards\nenvironmental concerns at the expense of social and governance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re completely destroying the water\n\n\n\nHis company is focused on investing in impoverished regions to help resolve\nlocal poverty, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Barrick\u2019s disclosures about payments to foreign governments, in\n2021 the company paid US$170,000 in taxes in Argentina. In 2020, the company\npaid US$210,000 in taxes and US$12 million for infrastructure improvements in\nthe country.\n\n\n\n\n\nZeballos, the resident of San Jose de Jachal, objected to the idea that\nBarrick was making a large economic difference in the community, saying the\ncompany\u2019s environmental legacy would be pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re completely destroying the water,\u201d he said through the translators.  \n __\n\n\n\n\n\n_\u2022 Email:gfriedman@postmedia.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s about 13 per cent of all Canadian mortgages\n\n\n\nSHARM EL-SHEIKH \u2014 A campaign by the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu for\nthe world\u2019s top court to take a stance on protecting people from climate\nchange gained momentum on Friday, winning the support of almost half the\nnearly 200 countries at a global summit.\n\n\n\nSHARM EL-SHEIKH \u2014 A campaign by the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu for\nthe world\u2019s top court to take a stance on protecting people from climate\nchange gained momentum on Friday, winning the support of almost half the\nnearly 200 countries at a global summit.\n\n\n\nAbout half of variable-rate, fixed-payment mortgages have hit their trigger\nrates, bank estimates\n\n\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 The United Nations Security Council voted Thursday to\nmaintain an arms embargo on Somalia over strong objections from its\ngovernment, saying the al-Shabab \u201cterrorist group\u201d still seriously threatens\npeace and stability in the region and sanctions are needed to degrade its\nactivities.\n\n\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion\nand encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.

Mining, gas, timber, and\nother extractive industries are the most productive sectors of Papua New\nGuinea\u2019s otherwise ailing economy. But exploitation of these resources has\nalso led to violence, human rights abuse, corruption, and environmental\ndamage.\n\n\n\nThe Porgera gold mine\u2014the subject of this report\u2014is a potent symbol of both\nthe perils and the financial rewards that extractive industries hold for Papua\nNew Guinea. The mine is 95 percent owned and solely operated by Barrick Gold,\na Canadian corporation that is the world\u2019s largest gold mining company. It has\nbeen a central part of Papua New Guinea\u2019s economy since it opened in 1990, but\nits operations have consistently been mired in controversy and tarnished by\nallegations of abuse.\n\n\n\nThis report is, first and foremost, an attempt to set the record straight on\none of the world\u2019s most controversial\u2014and most misunderstood\u2014mining ventures.\nThe following pages describe a pattern of violent abuses, including horrifying\nacts of gang rape, carried out by members of the mine\u2019s private security force\nin 2009 and 2010. They also recount Barrick\u2019s history of angrily dismissing\nhuman rights and environmental concerns that the company should have treated\nmore seriously and dealt with more transparently. On the other hand the report\nalso describes how more recently, Barrick has taken some meaningful steps\u2014and\npromised others\u2014to address some of the mine\u2019s most serious human rights\nproblems.\n\n\n\nPorgera sits in a remote part of Papua New Guinea\u2019s restive highlands that the\ngovernment had largely ignored until the mine\u2019s development. Because of the\nmine, Porgera has gone from being a forgotten backwater to one of the primary\nengines of the national economy. Since 1990 the Porgera Joint Venture (PJV)\nhas produced more than 16 million ounces of gold and accounted for roughly 12\npercent of Papua New Guinea\u2019s total exports. Barrick acquired the mine in 2006\nwhen it took over Placer Dome, the Canadian company that had developed the\nmine and operated it from the time it opened.\n\n\n\nThe Porgera mine has always been controversial. For years, local activists\nhave alleged that mine security personnel carry out extrajudicial killings and\nother violent abuses against illegal miners and other local residents. The\nmine has also been widely condemned for discharging six million tons of liquid\ntailings (mine waste) into the nearby Porgera River each year, a dangerous\npolicy that is not consistent with industry good practice. The relationship\nbetween the mine\u2019s management and its most prominent local critics is deeply\ndysfunctional, with both sides often more focused on attacking one another\nthan addressing issues of mutual concern.\n\n\n\nIn spite of all the wealth it generates, Porgera still suffers from poverty\nand a dearth of basic government services. Government authorities have also\nfailed to address new local problems that are directly related to the mine\u2019s\ndevelopment, including the health impacts of mercury use by small-scale and\nillegal miners in the area.\n\n\n\nViolent insecurity is a chronic problem around Porgera, in part because the\nmine has attracted economic migrants, a diverse group including men, women,\nand children. Many engage in illegal mining and some participate in violent\ncrime and other activities that destabilize the area. For most people this\namounts to a dreary and non-violent routine, chipping away at discarded bits\nof rock on the mine\u2019s vast waste dumps for a paltry income. But some illegal\nminers organize daring, violent raids on the mine\u2019s open pit, underground\ntunnels, or stockpile areas, often clashing with mine security personnel.\nThese raids occur almost every night.\n\n\n\nThe government has consistently failed to maintain law and order in the face\nof these security challenges. There is widespread public distrust of police in\nPapua New Guinea due to the force\u2019s reputation for violent abuses and\nincompetence. Only a handful of poorly equipped regular police officers are\ndeployed to Porgera, where they are not just responsible for the mine, but\nalso for policing a region plagued by violent crime and frequent tribal\nfights. Largely for this reason, Barrick employs nearly 450 private security\npersonnel under PJV\u2019s Asset Protection Department. It is also an important\nreason why, in 2009, Barrick agreed to bear most of the cost of a government\ndeployment of mobile police squads to Porgera. Both courses of action have led\nto serious accusations of abuse against the company.\n\n\n\nAfter acquiring the mine in 2006 Barrick took a number of steps intended to\nmake the security force it inherited from Placer Dome more disciplined and in\nline with international norms like the Voluntary Principles on Security and\nHuman Rights, which Barrick joined in October 2010. But as this report shows,\nthose steps were inadequate and failed to prevent serious abuses including\nabuse of people in custody, excessive use of force, and even gang rape.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s research found that mine security personnel were\ngenerally well-disciplined when faced with the most challenging situations\nthey have to deal with, violent nighttime raids by illegal miners on the\ncentral areas of the mine. But when operating further afield\u2014and under less\nrigorous supervision by superiors\u2014some security personnel have committed\nviolent abuses against men and women, many of them illegal miners engaged in\nnonviolent scavenging for scraps of rock. The abuses investigated by Human\nRights Watch all occurred on or near the sprawling waste dumps around the\nmine.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch documented five alleged incidents of gang rape by mine\nsecurity personnel in 2009 and 2010, and a sixth in 2008. We believe these\nincidents represent a broader pattern of abuse by some PJV security personnel.\nSubsequent investigations carried out by Barrick and by the Papua New Guinea\npolice in response to Human Rights Watch\u2019s allegations have discovered other\nalleged incidents of rape by PJV security personnel, separate from those\ndocumented by Human Rights Watch. In January 2011 PJV announced that it was\nfiring 6 employees for involvement in, or failure to report, alleged incidents\nof sexual violence. Some of those individuals were subsequently arrested by\nthe police.\n\n\n\nSome of the women interviewed by Human Rights Watch described scenes of true\nbrutality. One woman told how she was gang raped by six guards after one of\nthem kicked her in the face and shattered her teeth. Another said she and\nthree other women were raped by ten security personnel, one of whom forced her\nto swallow a used condom that he had used while raping two other victims.\n\n\n\nSeveral women said that after arresting them for illegal mining on the waste\ndumps, guards gave them a \u201cchoice\u201d of submitting to gang rape or going to\nprison to face fines and possible jail time. But in some of those cases the\nwomen said that guards raped them even after they pleaded with their\nassailants to take them to jail.\n\n\n\nIn Porgera, rape survivors have few options for assistance or redress. The\nwomen that Human Rights Watch spoke to said they feared reporting abuses to\nthe authorities given the fear of retribution, the threat of punishment for\nillegal mining, and the social stigma that affects rape victims around\nPorgera. These fears are heightened in a country where abuses by the police\nare endemic and complaints of sexual harassment and violence by police\nofficers is common. Furthermore, Barrick did not establish safe or accessible\nchannels for community members to report abuses by Barrick employees directly\nto company authorities.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch also interviewed people who said that mine security guards\nbeat them up or threatened them after they were already in custody, or that\nguards used excessive force to apprehend them. Some people alleged that they\nwere kicked or punched while lying handcuffed on the ground or on the floor of\nsecurity personnel\u2019s cars. Others said that they were tear-gassed or shot with\nless lethal projectile weapons without any warning or chance to surrender. One\n15-year-old boy told us that security guards threatened to unleash an attack\ndog on him after he had already been detained and handcuffed.\n\n\n\nIn addition to all of this, Barrick has come under considerable fire for\nabuses carried out by mobile police squads that have been deployed to Porgera\nsince 2009 to improve the overall law and order situation in the area. The\ncompany houses and feeds the mobile squads and provides other material support\nto them. Some critics argue that Barrick should withdraw this support, but\ncompany officials say the government would not sustain the deployment if it\ndid so. Overall, the mobile deployment has contributed to a sharp reduction in\nviolent crime and insecurity around Porgera that is welcomed by most local\nresidents. But its members have also been implicated in serious abuses, most\nnotably the 2009 destruction of a community called Wuangima and the forced\neviction of its residents.\n\n\n\nToo often, Barrick has responded with dismissive hostility to concerns about\nits human rights record at Porgera. But more recently the company appears to\nbe making substantial efforts to engage more constructively and transparently\nwith these issues. Human Rights Watch carried on a sustained dialogue with\ncompany officials regarding the allegations in this report. Barrick retained\nformer Commissioner of Police and Ombudsman Ila Geno to investigate Human\nRights Watch\u2019s allegations and then conducted an in-depth internal\ninvestigation of the entire PJV security force. Company officials ultimately\nacknowledged that there are abusive members of the PJV security force and\nvowed to remedy the situation. Barrick also committed itself to specific\nmeasures that could improve accountability and reduce opportunities for abuse.\nThe company has also provided material support to a criminal investigation\ninto the allegations of sexual violence.\n\n\n\nOne of Barrick\u2019s most glaring failures at Porgera has been its inadequate\neffort to monitor the conduct of mine security personnel working in the field,\nespecially on relatively isolated parts of the waste dump. Another has been\nthe company\u2019s failure to establish a safe and accessible channel that people\ncan use to complain about alleged abuses by security guards or other company\nemployees. Barrick has committed itself to taking steps designed to address\nboth failings, described in detail in the pages that follow. Human Rights\nWatch welcomes these moves, but their ultimate value will depend entirely on\nwhether they succeed in preventing abuse and ensuring accountability for\nabuses that do occur.\n\n\n\nBarrick has also committed to providing Human Rights Watch with copies of its\nmost current environmental reports when they are finalized, along with other\ndocuments. In Human Rights Watch\u2019s view, the company should have made these\npublic long ago. Doing so now will allow informed independent scrutiny of the\nlikely downstream impacts of the mine\u2019s practice of riverine tailings\ndisposal, which local communities and international campaigners alike have\ncriticized.\n\n\n\nThere is one essential component of adequate management of the situation at\nPorgera that is still completely lacking: responsible government regulation.\nThe Papua New Guinea government exercises no meaningful day-to-day oversight\nover the Porgera mine\u2019s private security force, and it is not clear that it\nhas the capacity to do so. In fact, the government has often appeared more\ninterested in quashing community objections to lucrative extractive projects\nthan regulating those projects effectively.\n\n\n\nSince most of the world\u2019s international mining and exploration\ncompanies\u2014including Barrick\u2014 are Canadian, one might expect the Canadian\ngovernment to exercise some oversight over its corporate citizens abroad. This\ncould have particular impact in poorly regulated environments like Papua New\nGuinea. But this is not the case; Canada has thus far chosen to exercise\nlittle oversight of Canadian companies operating overseas, including those in\nthe extractive industry. Legislation that would have empowered government\nministries to exercise a modest degree of scrutiny over the human rights\nrecords of extractive industry companies was defeated in Canada\u2019s House of\nCommons in October 2010. The bill was fiercely opposed by the mining industry,\nincluding Barrick, which vocally opposed the bill\u2019s passage. This missed\nopportunity challenges Canada\u2019s government, and the industry itself, to\nchampion new legislation capable of redressing very serious abuses that can\nand have happened under the watch of Canadian companies operating abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report is based primarily on a three-week research mission by a Human\nRights Watch researcher to Porgera and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Human\nRights Watch carried out 92 interviews with Porgeran landowners, victims, and\neyewitnesses of abuse at Porgera, people who had been detained by PJV security\npersonnel, local activists, company officials, medical personnel, illegal\nminers, current and former PJV security personnel, Porgera Environmental\nAdvisory Komiti (PEAK) officials, independent analysts, and police and\njudicial officials.\n\n\n\nWe also carried out interviews with experts on extractive industries and\npolicing in Papua New Guinea at The Australian National University in\nCanberra, Australia. Human Rights Watch consulted with former PJV employees\nand with independent experts on mine tailings disposal and related\nenvironmental and health issues.\n\n\n\nThe names and other identifying details of some interviewees\u2014including all\nvictims of or witnesses to human rights abuses at the Porgera mine\u2014have been\nwithheld at their request or to prevent possible reprisal against them.\nInterviews referenced in footnotes as having taken place in \u201cPorgera\u201d took\nplace either in Porgera Station, Paiam Town, Laigam, on or near one of the\nwaste dumps surrounding the mine, or in one of the communities scattered\naround the mine\u2019s Special Mining Lease or Lease for Mining Purposes area.\n\n\n\nAfter the research in Papua New Guinea was complete, Human Rights Watch\nengaged in an extended dialogue with Barrick officials. Barrick provided a\n20-page letter in response to a series of questions about the company\u2019s human\nrights and environmental practices and the allegations in this report. Company\nofficials also hosted a day-long meeting at Barrick\u2019s Toronto office on\nSeptember 9, 2010, to discuss the report\u2019s allegations and measures the\ncompany is taking to address them. In December 2010 Barrick sent Human Rights\nWatch another letter explaining actions the company has taken in response to\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s allegations of violence by PJV security guards. All of\nBarrick\u2019s input was fully incorporated into this report, and the December 2010\nletter is attached as an annex.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch also participated in a second day-long meeting between\nBarrick officials and NGO representatives in connection with Barrick\u2019s\napplication to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.\nThat meeting, which was off-the-record, dealt with human rights concerns that\nlargely overlapped with many of the issues discussed in this report. In\nNovember 2010 Human Rights Watch carried out a one-week follow-up visit to\nPorgera, meeting with company officials to discuss Barrick\u2019s efforts to\naddress Human Rights Watch\u2019s concerns and with local community members to\ndiscuss important human rights issues.\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea is a poor country that possesses a wild abundance of natural\nresources.[1]Mining in particular has long been one of the country\u2019s most\nimportant economic engines, as of 2002 the industry accounted for 75 percent\nof exports and 21 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).[2]And the country\u2019s\nextractive industries sector continues to grow: an ambitious liquefied natural\ngas project led by ExxonMobil, now in its early stages of development, could\ndouble Papua New Guinea\u2019s GDP over the next three decades.[3]\n\n\n\nMany Papua New Guineans believe that these industries are their country\u2019s\nbest\u2014and perhaps only\u2014realistic avenue to economic development. But as is true\nin many developing countries, Papua New Guinea\u2019s extractive resources have\nproved to be as much a curse as they have a blessing. Extractive projects and\nthe economic resources they represent have fueled violent conflict, abuse, and\nenvironmental devastation in Papua New Guinea.[4] Government revenues from\nextractive industries are often dissipated through official corruption and\nmismanagement, without having any positive impact on ordinary citizens\u2019\nlives.[5]\n\n\n\nThe Porgera gold mine is in many ways emblematic of both the promise and the\npitfalls of Papua New Guinea\u2019s extractives sector. Located in a remote corner\nof Papua New Guinea\u2019s highland Enga province, the mine is owned by a company\ncalled the Porgera Joint Venture (PJV). PJV in turn is 95 percent owned by\nBarrick Gold, a Canadian company that is the world\u2019s largest gold producer.[6]\nThe remaining five percent stake in PJV is held by Mineral Resources Enga, a\ncompany that is jointly owned by the Enga Provincial Government and the\nlandowners of Porgera.\n\n\n\nBarrick acquired the Porgera mine in 2006 when it purchased Placer Dome, the\ncompany that had developed the mine and operated it since it began production\n1990.[7] Barrick was already a large international company when it purchased\nPlacer Dome, but it came of age as a company with that acquisition, increasing\ndramatically in size and taking on board several complex and troubled\noperations, including the Porgera mine.[8] Since 2006 Barrick has been the\nmine\u2019s sole operator.\n\n\n\nGold mining was not entirely new to Porgera when PJV arrived on the scene;\nsmall-scale alluvial mining downstream from the modern mine had long been an\nimportant part of the local economy. Still, prior to the mine\u2019s development,\nPorgera was one of the most remote, impoverished, and marginalized areas in\nthe whole of Papua New Guinea. Geographically isolated by a dramatic landscape\nof steep valleys and rain-soaked mountains, the area lacked good road or air\nconnections to the rest of the country. For years the government had\nessentially left Porgera and its Ipili-speaking people to fend for\nthemselves.[9]\n\n\n\nThe sprawling mine has brought dramatic change to surrounding communities,\nespecially for landowners on the Special Mining Lease (SML) and Lease for\nMining Purposes (LMP) where the mine\u2019s operations take place. PJV employs some\n2,400 people and has paid out more than 280 million kina (K), or US$106\nmillion, in royalty payments to local landowners and the Enga Provincial\nGovernment.[10] These benefits are tremendously important; as one expert\nnoted, many Porgerans have always seen the mine as \u201ctheir only possible chance\nto catch up to the rest of Papua New Guinea after years of neglect.\u201d[11]But\nthe mine\u2019s development has also led to many destructive changes, including\nincreased levels of violence, prostitution, alcoholism, sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STDs), economic inequality, and other social ills.[12]\n\n\n\nSince becoming operational in 1990, the Porgera gold mine has produced well\nover 16 million ounces of gold, an amount that would be worth more than $19\nbillion at 2010 prices.[13] In 1992 the mine was the third largest gold\nproducer in the world.[14] Productivity has declined since then with the\nexhaustion of the mine\u2019s highest-grade deposits, but the PJV mine remains a\ntremendously important part of Papua New Guinea\u2019s national economy. In 2009\nthe 572,595 ounces of gold it produced was valued at K1.5 billion ($570\nmillion)\u201412.6 percent of the country\u2019s total exports that year.[15] The mine\nis currently projected to operate through 2023.[16]\n\n\n\nThe Porgera mine has had a dramatic impact on its environment. The operation\nhas largely obliterated a peak called Waruwari hill by creating a massive open\npit whose stepped rock walls fall hundreds of feet from the pit\u2019s upper\nreaches to its floor.[17]The pit bustles around the clock with workers and\nheavy equipment. Human Rights Watch\u2019s researcher observed rocks the size of\ncars crashing down unstable portions of the pit wall.\n\n\n\nThe upper reaches of the nearby Porgera river run red, stained by 16,000 tons\nof tailings (liquid mine waste) that PJV discharges into the river every\nday.[18] The mine has also spawned three vast dumps of waste rock\u2014stone with\nsuch low quantities of gold ore that it is not economical to process\u2014 and\nthese have buried huge tracts of bush, forest, and farmland as they grow. Two\nof the dumps are designed to be erodible and have advanced down the\nmountainside like glaciers of mud and rock, consuming everything in their\npath.[19]\n\n\n\nMining operations at Porgera have lasted longer and grown larger than\noriginally expected.[20]The expansion of the mine and its sprawling waste\ndumps has greatly reduced the amount of land available to adjacent communities\nfor cultivation and living space. At the same time the population has soared\nfrom roughly 6,000 to somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000, largely due to\neconomic migration from other parts of Enga province and beyond. Young people\nin particular often complain that they have seen no benefit from compensation\nagreements negotiated with their elders, and that the scarcity of land means\nthat they can neither build houses of their own nor turn to the soil to earn a\nliving.\n\n\n\nLargely because of these issues, the vast majority of landowners believe\nBarrick should relocate all of them to new land away from the mine.[21] \u201cWe\nwant to move out where there is a bigger place and where we can move around,\u201d\none landowner told Human Rights Watch, \u201cinstead of living like rats.\u201d[22]\n\n\n\nIn 2007 Barrick hired a firm to develop a plan to relocate most or all of the\nSpecial Mining Lease population, but the idea was ultimately abandoned,\nangering many local community leaders. Barrick maintains the plan was\nconceived as a prerequisite to a planned expansion of the mine that never took\nplace, robbing the hypothetical exercise of its intended purpose.[23] But a\ndraft copy of the relocation plan\u2019s social impact assessment stated that\n\u201cresettlement is driven by the need both to secure the land required for\nexpansion of PJV\u2019s operations and to improve living conditions in PJV\u2019s host\ncommunities.\u201d In addition the draft impact assessment found that:\n\n\n\nThe report also noted that 84 percent of surveyed SML landowners believed that\nlife was much worse than it had been five years before.[24]\n\n\n\nBarrick acknowledges that in the next few years it will have to relocate\nseveral hundred households that are \u201cimpacted by mining activities to an\nunacceptable degree, specifically, where there is a risk of geotechnical,\nhealth or other safety impacts.\u201d Indeed the company has ongoing plans to\nrelocate several hundred households, and has budgeted $40 million for\n\u201crelocation activities\u201d between 2010 and 2014.[25] But Barrick maintains that\nwholesale relocation of the population immediately surrounding the mine is\nunnecessary. It also argues that past efforts to explore its feasibility\nrevealed that the exercise would be so complex as to be impossible in\npractical terms.[26]\n\n\n\nSome former PJV employees and consultants disagree, arguing that it could be\npossible to gradually relocate all mining lease area landowners before the\nprojected closure of the mine sometime after 2023.[27] One former PJV employee\ntold Human Rights Watch, \u201cThe test should be, \u2018Would this be acceptable if it\nwere in my own back yard?\u2019 ... That\u2019s clearly not the case for many people\n[around Porgera].\u201d[28] On the other side of the issue, one optimistic Barrick\nofficial speculated that if the mine closes in 2023, most of Porgera\u2019s\nproblems will automatically resolve because at that time \u201cthe [economic\nmigrants] will all leave. The locals will have their education and the other\ndividends of PJV having been there.\u201d[29]\n\n\n\nOne serious barrier to addressing contentious issues related to the mine is\nBarrick\u2019s mutually antagonistic relationship with the Porgera Landowners\nAssociation (PLOA). The PLOA was conceived as a representative body with a\nmandate to speak for landowning communities and advocate for their collective\ninterests. It was established to represent landowners in negotiating important\nissues with the company or liaising with relevant government institutions.\n\n\n\nThe PLOA leadership and Barrick generally behave less like negotiating\npartners than mortal enemies. PLOA leaders have been consistently and vocally\ncritical of PJV\u2014often in vitriolic terms\u2014and long-serving PLOA Chairman Mark\nTony Ekepa regularly travels to Canada to protest at Barrick\u2019s annual\nshareholder meeting.[30] Barrick officials, for their part, try to cut the\nPLOA out of their dealings with local communities as much as possible. In\ninterviews with Human Rights Watch, Barrick officials described the PLOA\u2019s\nleadership as focused on exploiting local grievances for their own financial\ngain rather than acting in good faith as intermediaries between the company\nand local communities.[31]\n\n\n\nThe essence of the allegations leveled against the PLOA by Barrick officials\nand aggrieved community members is that the organization\u2019s leaders are lining\ntheir pockets with royalty payments that might otherwise flow to ordinary\nlandowners. The PLOA is a well-resourced institution: in 2009 it received K3.6\nmillion ($1.4 million) in royalty payments, a figure comparable in scale to\nthe K4.5 million ($1.7 million) in royalties paid out in direct distributions\nto all of the SML\u2019s landowners that year.[32]But there is no transparency as\nto how the organization spends its money. None of the landowners interviewed\nby Human Rights Watch\u2014including several people on PLOA\u2019s board\u2014had ever seen a\ndetailed accounting of how the organization uses its financial resources. Some\nsaid that they had spent considerable energy trying to get this information,\nwithout success.[33]\n\n\n\nWhen Human Rights Watch asked for a copy of the PLOA\u2019s budget, the deputy\nchairman of the PLOA maintained that only the organization\u2019s chairman had\naccess to it (the chairman was out of the country when Human Rights Watch\ncarried out our research in Porgera). Asked to describe generally how the PLOA\nspends its money, the deputy chairman mentioned \u201cstaff such as computer\noperators and so on\u201d for each of the landowner representatives on the PLOA\u2019s\nboard. In fact, none of those representatives have any staff at all, let alone\n\u201ccomputer operators.\u201d[34]If the PLOA does produce an end-of-year expenditure\nreport, none of the PLOA officials or landowner representatives interviewed by\nHuman Rights Watch knew about it.\n\n\n\nMany Porgeran landowners\u2014including some of the very people who serve on the\nPLOA\u2019s board\u2014express deep concern and even outrage at the opacity surrounding\nthe PLOA\u2019s finances. One landowner on the PLOA\u2019s board told Human Rights Watch\nthat he and other board members had repeatedly asked for expenditure reports,\nonly to be rebuffed.[35] Landowners have become divided into factions who\nsupport and oppose the PLOA leadership, and political infighting between the\ntwo sides has consumed considerable energy and resources, to no productive\nend.\n\n\n\nOne does not have to look far to see how things could be handled better. For\nexample, the Lihir Mining Area Landowners Association\u2014the equivalent of the\nPLOA around the Lihir gold mine on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Niolam Island\u2014published\nan audited report of its 2008 expenditures in a local newspaper.[36]\n\n\n\nThe PLOA\u2019s executive leadership did not respond well to questions about the\norganization\u2019s finances. Instead of responding to substantive concerns about\nfinancial mismanagement, PLOA Chairman Mark Tony Ekepa merely asserted to\nHuman Rights Watch that all the people complaining about the PLOA\u2019s lack of\nfinancial transparency were \u201cpaid by the company\u201d to discredit him. PLOA\nofficial Anga Atalu echoed this absurd allegation, saying of the PLOA\u2019s many\ncritics that \u201ctheir words have been fed to them by Barrick.\u201d Then, becoming\nvisibly angry, he demanded that Human Rights Watch stop pursuing the issue:\n\u201cThis is not among the issues you are investigating! It is not your interest\nto know what we are doing on this! It is not relevant and we do not wish to\nrespond to these allegations.\u201d[37]\n\n\n\nIn recent years PLOA leaders have exerted considerable energy trying to force\nPJV to negotiate relocation packages through them instead of directly with\nindividuals and communities who need to be moved from their homes. Ekepa and\nhis supporters maintain that this is a principled position designed to force\nthe company to deal with the broader issue of relocation, and prevent it from\nisolating small groups of landowners and pressuring them to accept bad\ndeals.[38] On the other hand, Barrick officials and some landowners allege the\nPLOA leadership is mainly concerned with steering cash payments through their\nown hands.[39] \u201cWe are never going to negotiate with the PLOA on benefit\npackages or give them to them to channel,\u201d one company official said. \u201cIf we\ndo, the benefits will never get to where they are supposed to go.\u201d[40]\n\n\n\nPorgera, like many other parts of Papua New Guinea\u2019s notoriously restive Enga\nprovince, is plagued by diverse forms of violence ranging from tribal warfare\nand armed robbery to widespread domestic violence.[41] The presence of the PJV\nmine has exacerbated this long-standing problem.[42] The mine has attracted\nthousands of migrants from other parts of the highlands, which has helped the\nlocal population surge from roughly 6,000 people in 1989 to somewhere between\n30,000 and 50,000 today.[43]This runaway growth has exacerbated social\nproblems, including widespread violence, alcoholism, and grinding poverty.[44]\n\n\n\nPorgera has at times approached true lawlessness. A joint PJV\/government\nreport noted that \u201c[v]iolent crimes against the person, in particular, have\nincreased in recent years, with reported rates of murder, assault, sexual\nassault against women and violence against children all rising over recent\nyears\u201d, and that tribal fighting \u201cincreased dramatically in Porgera district\u201d\nin the years leading up to 2007, with an estimated 70 people killed in such\nconflicts that year.[45] One scholar, working with local magistrates,\ndocumented 59 separate incidents of clan warfare around Porgera between 2006\nand 2009.[46]\n\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea government has failed to install an adequate regular\npolice presence around Porgera. As of May 2010 there were only 17 regular\npolice officers posted to the police station in Paiam town and they did not\npossess a functioning automobile.[47] More than 12 years ago the government\nagreed to increase the number of regular police officers stationed at Porgera\nto \u201ca minimum of 30,\u201d but this never happened.[48] The police have generally\nfailed to maintain any semblance of law and order in local communities, let\nalone deal with the complex security issues facing the mine.\n\n\n\nThis state of affairs poses immense challenges to PJV\u2019s operations. In the\nabsence of any meaningful regular police presence, the mine is forced to\nmaintain a large private security force.\n\n\n\nThe most serious security problem this force confronts on a routine basis is\nwidespread illegal mining on PJV property. Almost all of the abuses described\nin this report occurred in the course of PJV security personnel\u2019s efforts to\nconfront illegal miners and other trespassers on mine property. But while all\nillegal mining entails trespassing onto mine property to illegally obtain ore,\nthere are two very different kinds of illegal mining taking place at Porgera\nevery day. Paradoxically, the victims of almost all the abuses described in\nthis report were the illegal miners who pose the least threat of violence or\ndanger to the mine.\n\n\n\nEvery day hundreds of illegal miners trespass onto the mine\u2019s sprawling\nAnjolek, Anawe, and Kogai waste dumps, searching for scraps of rock that\ncontain salvageable quantities of gold. They are a diverse group that includes\nmen, women, and children of all ages. Almost every day\u2014and often well into the\nnight\u2014it is possible to see people working alone or in groups scattered across\ndifferent parts of the dumps, squatting on the ground, and chipping away at\nbits of rock with chisels and hammers. Their efforts to grind a living out of\nthe mine\u2019s fields of discarded rock generally yield a paltry but fairly steady\nincome. Most miners interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they took\nbetween K50 and K70 ($25-35) worth of gold from the waste dumps in an average\nweek.[49]\n\n\n\nMost of the illegal miners also said that they viewed the mine, including its\nwaste dumps, as their de facto \u201cgarden,\u201d a place they had no choice but to\nharvest as best they could.[50] One man living near the site told Human Rights\nWatch, \u201cI get up there early at six o\u2019clock, just like the people who work at\nthe mine. If I\u2019m lucky I can come back with enough to buy a packet of rice or\nsome other food. Otherwise, I stay down there until I find something.\u201d[51]\n\n\n\nThe waste rock is of no value to PJV, and the illegal miners on the waste\ndumps are for the most part engaged in a dreary but entirely nonviolent\nroutine. But company officials told Human Rights Watch that if left unchecked,\nillegal mining activity would draw vast numbers of people, posing serious\nsecurity threats to the mine and to PJV personnel dumping rock on the\ndumps.[52]For those reasons, PJV security patrols regularly try to chase away\nor arrest illegal miners they find on the waste dumps, and violent clashes\nsometimes follow.\n\n\n\nIn sharp contrast to the monotonous routine that characterizes illegal mining\non the waste dumps, a much smaller number of illegal miners organize violent\nraids on the mine\u2019s open pit operation, stockpile, or underground areas. The\nraids typically occur late at night and happen almost every day.Dozens of\nillegal miners\u2014and in some cases well over 100\u2014rush into the pit or rappel\ndown its steep rock walls and then try to fight off or elude any PJV security\npersonnel sent out to repel them. Many are armed with bush knives (machetes).\nThe goal of these raids is often to push into areas where rock newly blasted\nfrom the pit walls bearing high concentrations of valuable ore is heaped on\nthe floor of the open pit.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed several illegal miners who frequently\nparticipate in these raids. None attempted to conceal the violent nature of\ntheir tactics. One young man described the raids this way:\n\n\n\nThese violent raids are an enormous threat to the security of the mine and its\nemployees. From the perspective of many PJV security guards, they are a\nterrifying spectacle. One PJV security officer described the encounters this\nway:\n\n\n\nUnder Papua New Guinean law, illegal mining is punishable by up to four years\nin prison or a K10,000 ($3,800) fine.[55] The magistrate judge in Paiam town\nwho tries and sentences illegal miners told Human Rights Watch that many\npeople view these penalties as draconian when applied to people working\npeacefully on the waste dumps:\n\n\n\nDespite the harsh penalties, criminalization has proved ineffective as a means\nof dealing with the problem. According to local judicial officials, 476 people\nwere convicted of illegal mining under the Mining Act in 2009 and another 143\nbetween January and April 2010.[57] But Paiam\u2019s magistrate told Human Rights\nWatch that this had little meaningful effect as a deterrent and that many\nconvicted illegal miners were openly defiant. \u201cIn court they will tell you, \u201cI\nwill come back! That is my garden!\u201d he said.[58] According to Barrick, illegal\nminers staged more than 25,000 recorded incursions onto mine property\n(including the waste dumps) in 2009, and 9,600 during the first eight months\nof 2010.[59]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed many people who had been arrested and fined or\nimprisoned for illegal mining: almost all said they intended to continue with\nthe activity, often because they felt they had no choice.[60] In some cases\nthe primary impact of harsh criminal penalties for illegal mining around\nPorgera has been as a different kind of deterrent. Some PJV security personnel\nhave used the threat of fines or jail time to dissuade illegal miners from\ncomplaining about violent human rights abuses.\n\n\n\nPJV employs a private security force to protect the mine and its employees,\nwhich is run by the company\u2019s Asset Protection Department (APD). As of\nSeptember 2010 the APD force consisted of 443 personnel divided into three\nbroad categories\u2014279 \u201clocal hires\u201d who are recruited from around Porgera, 153\n\u201cnational hires\u201d recruited from across Papua New Guinea, and 11 expatriates in\ntraining and supervisory roles.[61] APD maintains an investigations unit that\nis responsible for investigating allegations of abuse and breaches of company\npolicy by APD personnel. PJV\u2019s budget for security was $10.2 million in\n2010.[62]\n\n\n\nAPD personnel patrol and guard the mine site, including the waste dumps around\nthe mine. They also apprehend and detain illegal miners, but in theory PJV\nrules do not permit them to detain people on the waste dumps unless they are\nengaging in illegal mining or other criminal activity. For example, many\npeople use the waste dumps as a shortcut to walk between their communities and\nPorgera Station or other communities, and APD personnel are instructed not to\narrest them.[63]\n\n\n\nPJV maintains a detention facility on the mine site, and illegal miners caught\nby APD personnel often spend a night there before being transferred into\npolice custody in neighboring Paiam town.[64] Barrick states that APD\npersonnel also assist with filing a complaint against the accused and testify\nagainst them in court if needed.[65]\n\n\n\nAPD\u2019s local hires generally have no background in security work and do not\ncarry firearms; PJV uses them primarily to carry out relatively\nstraightforward tasks like guarding fixed positions and acting as points of\ncontact with illegal miners and other community members. According to Barrick,\nthe local hires \u201cdo low risk activities\u2014manning gates and other fixed\npositions, or [taking on] negotiation roles where they are the second point of\ncontact behind Community Relations guys with illegal miners and so on.\u201d[66] In\ncontrast, many of APD\u2019s \u201cnational hires\u201d have a police or military background.\nSome are police reservists, and at least a few are regular police officers who\nhave taken extended leave from their jobs to accept better-paid positions with\nPJV.[67] The national hires do the heavy lifting; they are assigned the most\ndangerous duties, including confronting illegal miners in the open pit, and\nthey constitute the bulk of APD personnel who carry firearms.\n\n\n\nWhen Barrick acquired the Porgera mine in 2006, it inherited a security force\nthat local activists had long accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings\nand other violent abuses. The alleged victims were people caught trespassing\non mine property, most of them illegal miners.\n\n\n\nA 2005 report by a local organization called the Akali Tange Association (ATA)\nalleged PJV guards had shot and killed at least nine people between 1996 and\n2005 under circumstances that were impossible to justify, and injured several\nothers.[68]In November 2005, Placer Dome\u2014then the mine\u2019s operator and majority\nowner\u2014publicly acknowledged that police and PJV guards had shot and killed\neight people between 1996 and 2005 (including seven since 2000), but\nmaintained the killings were all carried out in self-defense.[69]\n\n\n\nThe ATA report also accused PJV personnel of killing several other people by\npushing them into the mine\u2019s open pit or crushing them with heavy rocks, but\nprovided little evidence to support the latter allegations.[70] PJV allegedly\npaid cash compensation in some cases to relatives of people killed or injured\nby PJV security guards in return for agreements barring the recipients from\npursuing legal action against the company.[71]In April 2010 a former PJV guard\nwas convicted of murder for a shooting death that took place on the mine site\nin 2002.[72]\n\n\n\nThe ATA report was controversial in part because its authors negotiated\nagreements with the families of deceased individuals that empowered the\norganization to seek monetary compensation for the alleged killings, and then\ngave ATA officials the right to divide any eventual payments between the\nfamilies and the organization however they saw fit.[73] By 2010, some families\nwhose agreements had also required them to provide a \u201cnon-refundable sum\u201d of\nK2000 (US$ 780) to the ATA so the organization could pursue their claims were\nhighly disgruntled because, years later, they had received nothing in\nreturn.[74]\n\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea government commissioned an inquiry into killings around\nthe PJV mine in 2005, but its results were never made public. The government\nhas never given a reason for its decision not to publish the\nresults.[75]Barrick officials said they could not confirm that abuses took\nplace prior to the company\u2019s purchase of Placer Dome.[76]\n\n\n\nMany APD personnel are former police officers, police reservists, or police on\nextended leave from their jobs. These personnel come to PJV with links to an\ninstitution well on its way towards what one expert described to Human Rights\nWatch as \u201cadvanced institutional collapse.\u201d[77]Violent abuses have become a\nroutine part of the police\u2019s interactions with the public, and police\npersonnel regularly engage in widespread abuses, including torture and\nrape.[78]\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2010 the UN special rapporteur on torture traveled to PNG and\ndocumented police abuses, including routine beatings of criminal suspects that\noften rise to the level of torture, as well as extortion of sex from female\ndetainees in exchange for their release. The special rapporteur noted that,\n\u201cSome officers also appear to frequently arrest women for minor offences with\nthe intention of sexually abusing them.\u201d[79] Fear of sexual harassment and\nviolence by police inhibits effective functioning of the justice system since\nvictims are often afraid to report crimes to the police.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these patterns of police abuse, rape\u2014and in particular gang\nrape or \u201cpack rape\u201d as it is called in Papua New Guinea\u2014is a disturbingly\ncommon crime throughout the country.\n\n\n\nAll of this means that Barrick should have been well aware of the serious\npotential for violent abuses to occur and could have prioritized setting up\neffective systems to prevent and respond to such abuse when it took over the\nPorgera mine in 2006. In fact, the patterns of abuse by APD personnel\ndescribed in this report largely mirror broader patterns of abuse by PNG\npolice.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s research revealed that some APD personnel at Porgera\nengaged in violent abuses with impunity in 2009 and 2010. Human Rights Watch\ninvestigated several alleged cases of gang rape by APD personnel, as well as\ninstances where APD personnel have allegedly beaten people in their custody or\nused excessive force apprehending them. None of these abuses took place during\nviolent raids by illegal miners on the mine\u2019s central open pit, where APD\npersonnel are under the direct scrutiny of their superiors. Rather, they all\ninvolved APD personnel patrolling relatively isolated expanses of the mine\u2019s\nwaste dumps.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch investigated five incidents of alleged rape by PJV security\npersonnel in 2009 and 2010, and one in 2008. Human Rights Watch interviewed\nwomen who were among the victims of five of these incidents and one woman who\nprovided a detailed eyewitness account of another gang rape. Five other women\ninterviewed by Human Rights Watch alleged they were threatened or taunted with\nthe prospect of rape after APD personnel arrested them.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch believes that the incidents of sexual violence we\ninvestigated are part of a broader pattern of abuse. We heard of other alleged\nvictims we could not locate or who declined to speak with us. In addition, the\npowerful stigma attached to rape survivors in PNG (discussed below) means that\nmany rape victims keep their ordeals to themselves. Barrick and the Papua New\nGuinea police both launched investigations into alleged acts of sexual\nviolence by APD personnel in response to the allegations put forward by Human\nRights Watch.[80]Those investigations, both ongoing as of November 2010,\nuncovered alleged incidents of sexual violence separate from those\ninvestigated by Human Rights Watch.[81] In January 2011 Barrick announced that\nit had fired 6 employees for involvement in, or failure to report, alleged\nincidents of sexual violence. Some of those individuals were subsequently\narrested by the PNG police.[82]\n\n\n\nThe allegations of rape documented by Human Rights Watch shared several key\nelements:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 **All of the incidents were gang rapes** by APD personnel.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 **All of the incidents took place on or near the waste dumps surrounding the\nmine**. Most victims were women who were illegally mining on the waste dumps.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 **Many of the victims said their attackers told them they would face large\nfines or prison time if they tried to complain after the fact,** because they\nhad been carrying out illegal mining on PJV property. Some women said that APD\npersonnel presented them with a \u201cchoice\u201d of going to prison or submitting to\ngang rape and then being set free\u2014but then still gang raped some of the women\nwho insisted on being taken to prison.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 **Most of the victims said that they were brutally beaten** in addition to\nbeing raped. Most were kicked or punched by their assailants; one woman was\nkicked in the face just before being raped and lost several teeth.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 **None of the victims reported the incidents to either police or company\nofficials.** All said either that they did not know where they could safely\ncomplain to, were afraid that they would suffer reprisals if they did report\nthe crimes, or both. Some women said that their attackers said they would be\nimprisoned or fined for illegal mining if they tried to complain about what\nhad happened.\n\n\n\nOne woman in her early 30s told Human Rights Watch that around the end of\nSeptember 2009, she was gang raped by five APD personnel who caught her on the\nKogai waste dump. She was not an illegal miner herself but had gone to the\ndump in hopes of selling betel nut to the illegal miners working there:\n\n\n\nThe APD personnel forced her into the back of their land cruiser and took\nturns raping her. When they had finished they took her out of the car, threw\nher on the ground, and kicked her several times. Then they left, but not\nbefore warning her that she would be punished for trespassing if she tried to\nreport the crime:\n\n\n\nShe never reported the crime.\u201cI was scared to go to the hospital or police\nstation,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid they would say, \u2018There is one of the people\nwho go up there to steal,\u2019 and lock me up.\u201d[83]\n\n\n\nAnother woman told Human Rights Watch that five APD personnel gang raped her\nafter catching her on the same waste dump around February 2010. She said that\nshe and her husband were arrested together. The guards put her husband into a\ncar and drove him away, while she was raped in some bushes near the edge of\nthe dump:\n\n\n\nAfter the guards finished raping her they let her go. \u201cAfter they raped me I\nwas lying on the ground for about two hours,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I went into\na stream [near] there and washed myself and I walked home.\u201d She did not report\nthe crime. \u201cI thought of doing that but since my husband was taken to jail I\nhad no one to support me in going there so I just left it that way. I was\nscared they might just lock me up in the cell.\u201d[84]\n\n\n\nIn 2009, a research team from Harvard and New York University (NYU) law\nschools submitted evidence to the Canadian parliament that APD personnel had\nbeen involved in numerous incidents of rape targeting women caught on mine\nproperty.[85]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team reported on ten alleged incidents of sexual violence (all separate\nfrom the incidents described in this report), including eight rapes, and\nstated that \u201cthe accounts generally share[d]\u201d several characteristics: the\nrapes occurred on mine property; the victims were gang-raped by groups of PJV\nsecurity guards; they were beaten in addition to being raped; some were\nthreatened with imprisonment if they did not submit to being raped; and women\ngenerally did not report or file complaints about the incidents.\u201d[86] These\ntraits largely mirror those of the incidents of gang rape investigated by\nHuman Rights Watch.\n\n\n\nBarrick issued a formal response to the Harvard\/NYU allegations, stating that\n\u201cto our knowledge, there have been no cases of sexual assault reported to mine\nmanagement involving PJV security personnel while on duty, since Barrick\nacquired its interest in the mine in 2006.\u201d It urged anyone who had\ninformation about such an incident to report it to the proper Papua New Guinea\n(PNG) government authorities but did not commit to action itself.[87]\n\n\n\nThe Harvard\/NYU research team also reported on several alleged killings by APD\npersonnel or police around the mine since 2006, and numerous instances of\nbeatings and other forms of physical abuse, both before and after Barrick\nacquired the mine.[88]\n\n\n\nA third woman told Human Rights Watch that APD personnel gang raped her on the\nKogai waste dump in January 2009. \u201cThe people together with me saw the\nsecurity and ran away,\u201d she said. \u201cI was also trying to run away but I tripped\non a stone and I fell down. Six security [personnel] held me.\u201d She said:\n\n\n\nAll six guards raped her on the ground in a relatively isolated area near\ntheir car. Afterwards they left her lying on the ground. Although in great\npain, she walked up to a road where she could catch a public bus. \u201cSomeone\njust held my hand and helped me to walk up,\u201d she said. She did not report the\ncrime to anyone; her attackers had said that if she did, she would be arrested\nfor stealing gold from the waste dump. \u201cWhen these security raped me they said\nI could go to prison for two to five years,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I was\nafraid to tell anyone.\u201d[89]\n\n\n\nFear of imprisonment and mistrust of the authorities is not the only thing\nthat prevents women from reporting incidents of rape. The social stigma that\nattaches to rape around Porgera is strong enough to ruin lives and lead to\nfurther violence in the home.\n\n\n\nOne woman told Human Rights Watch that she was gang raped by a group of PJV\nguards and did not tell anyone, including her husband. Nonetheless, he found\nout about the attack one week later and promptly divorced her. \u201cWe were only\nmarried one year when I was raped,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018You should have\ninformed me because I don\u2019t want you to be my wife after all these five\nsecurity men had their chance with you. I don\u2019t want this kind of woman to be\nmy wife.\u2019\u201d She added that she thought many rape victims keep their ordeals to\nthemselves \u201cbecause of things like what happened to me.\u201d[90]\n\n\n\nSeveral women told Human Rights Watch that they had heard stories of APD\npersonnel arresting women and then offering them a \u201cchoice\u201d of submitting to\ngang rape or going to prison. Several women said that for this reason, when\nthey were apprehended they immediately began insisting that the guards take\nthem directly to jail.[91]\n\n\n\nOne woman was cutting grass for a wealthy landowner\u2019s pig near one of the\nwaste dumps in June 2009 when she saw APD personnel apprehend several female\nillegal miners, drag them into nearby bushes, and begin raping them. Afraid\nthat she too would be raped, she fled across the dump, but ran into another\nAPD officer. \u201cI asked them to just arrest me,\u201d she said. \u201cI lied to that man\nand told him, \u2018I have a small baby in the house so don\u2019t rape me, it would not\nbe good.\u2019 \u2026 [But] he asked me, \u2018Do you want to go home or do you want to go to\njail?... If you want to go home, I\u2019ll [have sex with] you.\u2019\u201d She responded\nemphatically she wanted to go to jail, and was ultimately taken there without\nbeing hurt. She spent six days in prison at Paiam, was released on K500 bail,\nand was ultimately not convicted of an offense.[92]\n\n\n\nOther women relayed similar experiences. One woman said APD personnel\napprehended her on one of the dumps in April 2010 and began walking her\ntowards an isolated area:\n\n\n\nAnother woman, in her fifties, was caught working on one of the waste dumps\naround September 2009 and was put into an APD car with several APD personnel:\n\n\n\nThey did not say anything else, and took her to the PJV detention\nfacility.[94]\n\n\n\nSome women found that there was no \u201cchoice\u201d between going to jail or\nsubmitting to rape. One woman described how she was raped after being caught\nlooking for ore-bearing rock at the Kogai waste dump around March 2008:\n\n\n\nShe did not report the crime. \u201cI thought of going there to make a complaint,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cBut I was afraid the police would say, \u2018You deserved it because you\nwere going into that dump area.\u2019\u201d[95]\n\n\n\nOne young woman told Human Rights Watch that she was brutally gang raped by a\ngroup of PJV security guards who caught her and three other women on the\nmine\u2019s Kogai waste dump in February 2009:[96]\n\n\n\n _They dragged us all into the bush. One of them said, \u201cNo talking, don\u2019t\ntalk! Just remove your trousers.\u201d_\n\n\n\n _One security [guard] had a bush knife [machete] and he hit me on the back\nwith the flat of it\u2026I got mad and I bit him with my teeth on his shoulder.\nThen he got mad and cut me with his knife [above the left elbow]. Then he\nsaid, \u201cOh, you are tough lady,\u201d and then he ripped off all my clothes and I\nwas completely naked._\n\n\n\n _After that, six security [personnel] raped me. One would pull my left leg,\none would pull my right leg wide, one would hold each of my hands and one\nwould rape me. Then they would change places._\n\n\n\n _The security that cut me with the knife raped two of the other girls and\nused a condom. And then he came to me and opened my mouth wide and pushed his\npenis with the condom into my mouth. After he released \u2026 he made me swallow\nthe condom. But the condom went only halfway down my throat and I pulled it\nout._\n\n\n\n _I felt really sick and I tried to vomit and then I was unconscious. In the\nevening my relatives came looking for me and found me lying there._\n\n\n\n _They security [had] said, \u201cIf you go and lay a complaint at the police\nstation we will lock you up in the jail\u2014you ladies came to steal here so you\nwill go to jail and pay a very big fine.\u201d I was scared to lay a complaint\u2014I\ndid not know if they are doing this on the order of the company. Maybe if we\ngo there to complain they will just lock us up._\n\n\n\n _When people asked me how I was cut I said oh, I just accidentally cut myself\nwith my own knife. But my parents, I told them I had been raped. They could\nnot do anything, so I told them and we just left it like that._\n\n\n\n _I have lost a lot of weight\u2014I wasn\u2019t like this before, I used to be a fat\nwoman. Even when I see good food I think of the condom that was used on other\nladies pushed into my mouth and I do not feel good about eating._\n\n\n\n _I really got a bad name from that. [People who] saw me spread the news that\nI was raped and was chewing condoms. That really made me feel low._\n\n\n\n _I can still remember the faces of those six security [officers]. If I see\nthem again I will cut them with a bush knife or an axe and I don\u2019t care if I\ngo to prison. As long as I live I will think of this thing that happened to\nme._\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed more than two dozen people detained by APD\npersonnel. Aside from the alleged rape victims, a large majority said their\ncaptors treated them fairly and without abuse. But Human Rights Watch did hear\nof several cases where APD personnel allegedly committed abuses against people\nin their custody. As is the case with the gang rapes described above, almost\nall these incidents occurred on or near the mine\u2019s waste dumps, the areas\nwhere APD personnel operate furthest from direct scrutiny by their superiors\nwithin the force. People arrested by PJV security guards often spend the night\ndetained in a company-run detention facility inside the mine site before being\ntransferred to police custody in Paiam town. Almost all of the former\ndetainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they did not suffer\nabuse while in detention there, although a handful alleged that they had.\n\n\n\nOne young man told Human Rights Watch that he was looking for rocks on the\nAnawe waste dump with his father when both were surprised by a group of PJV\nsecurity guards who fired tear gas at them without warning. \u201cWhen I saw them I\ntried to run away and they shot me with tear gas,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell down on\nthe hard rocks. My father also fell down on the rocks.\u201d He said the guards\ncaught him and that six stood around him and his father, kicking the pair in\nthe ribs, stomach, and back with steel-toed boots as they lay helpless on the\nground. He was imprisoned and then released after paying a K1,500 ($570)\nfine.[97]\n\n\n\nA 15-year-old boy told Human Rights Watch that PJV security guards caught him\non the Anawe waste dump after he had walked across it to collect firewood. He\ntried to run away but tripped. \u201cI fell down and one of the security\n[personnel] came and held me,\u201d he said. \u201cOne just landed his fist on my face\u2014I\nstood up and he punched me in the face.\u201d He said that the guards handcuffed\nhim and then\u2014after he had already been cuffed\u2014repeatedly threatened to let\ntheir security dog attack him. \u201cThey were trying to let the dog bite me and I\nwas scared of the dog,\u201d he said.[98] Yet another young man said that after\narresting him, APD personnel held him down and sprayed him repeatedly in the\nface with a small aerosol canister full of pepper spray that burned his eyes\nand face.[99]\n\n\n\nA female illegal miner told Human Rights Watch that a PJV guard kicked her\nrepeatedly as she lay on the floor of a land cruiser after she had been\narrested. \u201cIt was a man who kicked me so it really hurt,\u201d she said. She also\nsaid that she was thrown to the ground and kicked by an APD security guard at\nthe mine detention site who asked her, \u201cYou people coming to this area, why do\nyou keep coming to this place?\u201d[100] A woman arrested on the Anawe dump in\nJuly 2009 said she was subjected to sexual harassment while in custody at the\nmine site:\n\n\n\nShe said that the guards ultimately left her and the other women detained with\nher unharmed. She was transferred into police custody the next morning.[101]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 21 people who said that they had been beaten,\nshot at, or tear gassed by APD personnel in 2009 and 2010. As discussed above,\nAPD personnel often face violent situations that justify responding with\nforce.[102] But in some cases they appear to have used force in circumstances\nthat are not permitted by international principles that form the basis for\ntheir own rules of engagement.\n\n\n\nBarrick says that its policies on the use of force by APD personnel are\n\u201caligned\u201d with key sources of international standards: the Voluntary\nPrinciples on Security and Human Rights, the UN Basic Principles on the Use of\nForce and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, and the UN Code of Conduct\nfor Law Enforcement Officials.[103]Generally speaking, accepted standards\nallow for the use of force in a wide array of circumstances\u2014including if\nnecessary to apprehend a criminal suspect\u2014but require that law enforcement\nofficials \u201cshall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting\nto the use of force and firearms. They may use force and firearms only if\nother means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the\nintended result.\u201d[104]\n\n\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch interviewed several illegal miners who described\nbeing shot with drag-stabilized beanbag projectiles (which they described as\n\u201crubber bullets\u201d) or tear gas without warning or any real chance to\nsurrender.[105] A few said that PJV security guards had fired tear gas at them\nwhile they were either fleeing or still scouring the dumps for rocks, not\nhaving yet seen the guards.[106]\n\n\n\nIn February 2009 increasing levels of violent insecurity around Porgera led\nthe government to deploy four police mobile squads to the area.[107] This move\ncame with a significant catch, the government was unwilling to bear the costs\nof the operation, so Barrick agreed to assume most of the responsibility for\nsupporting the mobile squads while they were in Porgera, including by housing\nand feeding them on PJV property.[108] The deployment remained in place as of\nSeptember 2010, though it had been reduced to two squads, or about 70 men.\n\n\n\nThe close relationship between PJV and the mobile police deployment was a\ncause of concern from the outset, police mobile squads have a long history of\nviolence and abuse directed at ordinary citizens.[109] Then, in April 2009,\nthe mobile squads attacked and burned a village adjacent to the mine called\nWuangima and destroyed homes in another village called Kulapi as well. In\nFebruary 2010, Amnesty International published a report documenting the\nwidespread violent abuses involved in these operations and condemned them as\nillegal forced evictions. Amnesty called for an independent inquiry into the\nabuses, appropriate remedies for the victims, and prosecution of those\nresponsible.[110]When Human Rights Watch visited Porgera in May 2010, Wuangima\nwas a deserted hillside littered with trash and the foundations of ruined\nhomes.\n\n\n\nBarrick initially maintained that Wuangima was not a permanent community at\nall but merely a collection of 35 \u201ccrude structures\u201d inhabited primarily by\ntransient criminals and illegal miners.[111] In fact, while Wuangima was often\nused as a staging point for raids on the open pit by illegal miners, the\ncommunity had many longtime residents and permanent structures including a\nchurch.[112] The company also made the astonishing assertion that, \u201cThere is\nno evidence that the PNG police who carried out the actions in question used\nexcessive or disproportionate force, or, indeed, that they used _any_ force,\u201d\neven though PJV employees in Porgera told Human Rights Watch they watched\nWuangima burn from inside the mine site.[113]Barrick has since partially\nbacked away from its initial, untenable position and acknowledged that homes\nwere destroyed.[114]The company still maintains that none of its personnel\nknew about any police plan to destroy Wuangima until they saw smoke rising\nfrom the burning houses.[115]\n\n\n\nBarrick has engaged Ila Geno, a respected former commissioner of police and\nombudsman, to make occasional trips to Porgera to monitor the conduct of the\nmobile squads there. His reports to Barrick are not public. While Geno\u2019s\nengagement is a positive step, there is still need for an independent\ninvestigation into the forced evictions of 2009. Geno\u2019s mandate does not\ninclude such an investigation.[116]\n\n\n\nA mobile squad section commander interviewed by Human Rights Watch in May 2010\nclaimed that the conduct of the deployment had improved since the 2009 forced\nevictions. \u201cWe are trying to work with people so the people know we are here\nto help them and not to chase them or harass them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe no longer\nbash [beat] people around like that.\u201d[117] But abuses did not halt altogether.\nIn July 2010 a group of mobile police allegedly kidnapped three teenage girls\nwhom they kept overnight at their quarters on the mine site and raped. Police\nofficials in Port Moresby took the unusual step of investigating the incident\nand suspended three officers it identified as responsible. Barrick officials\ntold Human Rights Watch that they had urged police officials to take the\nincident seriously and believed the perpetrators would be prosecuted.[118]\n\n\n\nOne fundamental question looms large in light of these abuses: should the\nmobile deployment in Porgera continue, and if so, under what terms? Amnesty\nInternational has called for Barrick to withdraw accommodation and other\nsupport to the mobile deployment in light of the 2009 forced evictions and the\nimpunity enjoyed by those responsible.[119]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch agrees that in principle the forces should not be housed\nand fed on the mine site, this creates the appearance of company control over\nthe police, as well as the possibility that inappropriate collusion could\noccur. But it is also true that the mobile deployment would probably end if\nBarrick stopped providing that support; the government has consistently\nrefused to commit the resources necessary to maintain law and order around\nPorgera.\n\n\n\nThe mobile deployment has by all accounts greatly reduced violence and crime\naround Porgera. Almost all local residents and officials interviewed by Human\nRights Watch said they wanted the mobile deployment to continue in Porgera.\nThe ranking police officer at Paiam police station said that in the months\nprior to the deployment, Porgera resembled \u201csome kind of Wild West area where\nnobody cared for anybody.\u201d He said the police were confronted with 10-15 rape\ncases and 5-6 murders every month, along with numerous armed robberies and\ntribal fights. \u201cI know for sure this lawlessness will come again after this\npolice operation is withdrawn,\u201d he asserted.[120] The head doctor at the\nhospital in Paiam town told Human Rights Watch that on a typical day in the\nmonths before the mobile deployment began, the hospital would treat three to\nfour serious injuries resulting from highway robberies, tribal fighting, or\ndomestic violence, and that such injuries were far less common since the\ndeployment began.[121]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch urges Barrick to do more to keep the mobile deployment at\narm\u2019s length from company operations, including by pressing the PNG government\nto provide room and board for the deployment off company premises. But we also\nrecognize the need to balance this goal against the importance of avoiding a\nreturn to the dismal situation that prevailed before the deployment.\n\n\n\nBarrick officials told Human Rights Watch they believe that the only viable\nlong-term solution to the chronic insecurity and violence around Porgera is\nfor the government to bolster the capacity of the area\u2019s regular police\npresence and justice sector institutions. In partnership with the national and\nprovincial governments, the company has launched an initiative that aims to\nincrease the number of police deployed to Porgera from 16 to 66 and improve\nthe quality of the infrastructure the force and the local courts rely on.\nBarrick has agreed to build or pay for much of the necessary infrastructure,\nincluding a new police barracks that should be completed in September 2011,\nbut the government will have to follow through on promises to supply the\npersonnel.[122]As Barrick\u2019s vice-president for security and crisis management\nput it, \u201cProblem one is getting a permanent police presence of the right\nnature. Problem two is influencing that police presence to operate in an\nappropriate way.\u201d[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough governments have primary responsibility for promoting and ensuring\nrespect for human rights, corporations also have a number of responsibilities,\nas increasingly recognized by international law and other norms. These norms\nreflect an expectation that corporations should have policies and procedures\nin place that ensure human rights abuses do not occur and that they undertake\nadequate due diligence to identify and effectively mitigate human rights\nproblems.[124]\n\n\n\nThis approach has been elaborated by John Ruggie, the United Nations special\nrepresentative of the secretary general on the issue of human rights and\ntransnational corporations and other business enterprises. Ruggie has\ndeveloped a framework known as the \u201cprotect, respect and remedy\u201d approach to\nbusiness-related human rights issues that in part outlines the basic steps\nthat companies should take to respect human rights, avoid complicity in\nabuses, and adequately remedy them if they occur.\n\n\n\nBarrick is a member of the UN Global Compact, a voluntary initiative which\nincorporates human rights commitments. Under the compact companies pledge\ntheir adherence to ten \u201cuniversally accepted principles in the areas of human\nrights, labour, environment and anti-corruption\u201d that derive from the\nUniversal Declaration on Human Rights and other texts.[125]One of the 10\nprinciples is that companies should \u201cmake sure that they are not complicit in\nhuman rights abuses.\u201d[126]\n\n\n\nOf most direct relevance to the abuses discussed above, Barrick has formally\nsubscribed to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (Voluntary\nPrinciples). The Voluntary Principles are a framework that brings together a\nrange of multinational extractive companies, home governments, and civil\nsociety organizations around a set of principles on the relationship between\nextractive companies and the public or private security forces they rely on\nfor protection. They focus on how companies should seek to prevent human\nrights abuses by those security forces as well as on how companies should\nrespond when abuses do occur.[127] While the company only joined the Voluntary\nPrinciples in October 2010, the company accepted them as \u201ca basis for the\noperation of all of Barrick\u2019s mines \u2026 incorporated into a number of different\ncompany policies\u201d even before it formally joined the process.[128]\n\n\n\nOf particular relevance in the context of Porgera, the Voluntary Principles\nask companies, inter alia, to:\n\n\n\nAs described below, Barrick has taken steps to implement the Voluntary\nPrinciples since acquiring the Porgera mine in 2006. However, those steps fell\nshort in a number of key respects, and failed to prevent or deter the abuses\ndescribed above. More recent steps\u2014many of them taken since mid-2010 in direct\nresponse to Human Rights Watch\u2019s allegations\u2014could do much to remedy these\ndeficiencies if implemented in good faith.\n\n\n\nLocal and international activists have criticized Barrick over alleged human\nrights abuses and environmental damage at operations around the world. In\nfact, one small group of international activists\u2014ProtestBarrick.net\u2014has led a\npermanent campaign specifically aimed at calling attention to alleged human\nrights abuses and environmental destruction at Barrick\u2019s worldwide operations,\nincluding at Porgera.[130] This has contributed to a siege mentality among\nsome Barrick officials.\n\n\n\nSome allegations leveled by critics of Barrick have been exaggerated or\nincorrect.[131] But too often in the past, Barrick has responded to legitimate\nhuman rights and environmental criticisms of the Porgera mine with a \u201cshoot\nthe messenger\u201d approach, attacking the company\u2019s critics while failing to\naddress important substantive concerns.\n\n\n\nTo cite two recent examples:\n\n\n\nMore recently Barrick has shown signs of a tangible shift toward more serious\nengagement with human rights concerns. One senior company official told Human\nRights Watch that \u201cOur approach has changed. We want to be more open. There\nare a lot of good things this company does \u2026 but we need to be more open to\ntalking about the bad things as well.\u201d[135]\n\n\n\nOver the course of several months beginning in May 2010, Barrick has engaged\nin a frank and substantive dialogue with Human Rights Watch about all of our\nconcerns regarding the Porgera mine. The company has also taken or promised to\ntake several meaningful steps to address the most serious human rights abuses\ndescribed in this report. The following pages describe those steps, as does\nthe letter from Barrick that is published as an annex to the report.[136]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch welcomes Barrick\u2019s commitments to act, but it was not yet\npossible at the time of writing to determine whether they would be implemented\neffectively and in good faith. And even highly effective efforts to prevent\nand respond to abuse in the future cannot obviate the need to ensure\naccountability for abuses that have already occurred.\n\n\n\nSince taking over PJV in 2006, Barrick has taken a number of steps to\nincorporate the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights into the\noperations of the APD force at Porgera. The company has funded external\nassessments of some of its operations, including Porgera, to determine what\nneeds to be done in order to align the operation with the Voluntary\nPrinciples. It has also produced a \u201cVoluntary Principles Standard\u201d that\n\u201cdefines the company\u2019s interpretation and detailed requirements for\nimplementation of the [Voluntary Principles], including responsibilities and\naccountabilities.\u201d Barrick also says that it \u201cseeks to have the Voluntary\nPrinciples recognized in any relevant dealings and agreements with Government\nagencies.\u201d[137] More specifically, the company says that it:\n\n\n\nWhile the measures described above are positive, PJV\u2019s efforts have fallen\nshort of what is required by the Voluntary Principles, and have failed to\nprevent violent abuses by APD personnel or ensure accountability for abuses\nthat do occur. In April 2010, Barrick\u2019s country director for Papua New Guinea\nresponded to a question about alleged abuses by APD personnel by saying:\n\n\n\nSuch statements hardly accord with the company\u2019s policy of taking all alleged\nabuses seriously. In general, though, the problem has lain not in the\ncompany\u2019s response to allegations of abuse by APD personnel but in its failure\nto detect abuses in the first place through internal channels, coupled with a\ntendency to regard external sources of allegations as not credible. In Human\nRights Watch\u2019s view, the company\u2019s efforts have fallen woefully short in two\nkey respects:\n\n\n\nIn the past Barrick has blithely stated that if incidents of sexual violence\ninvolving APD personnel did occur, either the victims or international\norganizations compiling their accounts should refer the matter to the police.\nThis was not only a deplorable abdication of responsibility on the part of the\ncompany, but also unrealistic. The police enjoy little public confidence to\nbegin with due to their reputation for violent abuse and incompetence, and\nmany victims fear retaliation since they suffered abuse after being arrested\nfor criminal activity. As discussed in detail above, this is a fear that some\nabusive APD personnel have effectively played upon to dissuade their victims\nfrom reporting abuses to the police.\n\n\n\nThese are crucial\u2014and inexcusable\u2014omissions. But Barrick does appear to have\nacknowledged these failures and to be taking serious measures to address them.\nAs the company itself put it, \u201cThe fact that these incidents may have\noccurred, that the PJV\u2019s inquiries failed to reveal them, and that women did\nnot raise these incidents with the PJV but openly spoke of them with Human\nRights Watch, tells us in clear and unmistakable terms that we have not met\nthe standards and expectations we set for ourselves in this regard.\u201d[153]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch provided Barrick officials in Porgera and Port Moresby with\na general overview of the allegations and concerns described in this report in\nMay 2010. We also attended an eight-hour meeting with senior Barrick officials\nin September 2010 to discuss these issues. In June 2010, at Barrick\u2019s request,\nwe provided a more detailed written summary of the incidents of sexual\nviolence described in this report. As described above, Barrick responded to\nthat information by retaining Ila Geno, a respected former commissioner of\npolice and ombudsman, to look into the allegations.[154]After initial\ninquiries in communities around Porgera, Geno recommended the police launch a\ncriminal investigation, which they ultimately did.[155] Geno told Human Rights\nWatch: \u201cI came to a point where there was cause for concern and I advised the\ncommissioner of police very strongly that there should be a police\ninvestigation.\u201d[156] Barrick officials agreed to provide logistical and other\nsupport to a team of police investigators who then traveled from the capital\nto carry out the investigation. The company also says that it proactively\nurged the police to dispatch experienced senior investigators and to ensure\nthat the investigating team included a female officer.[157] In addition,\nBarrick says that the company\u2019s own internal investigation into the\nallegations saw a team of 15 investigators carry out more than 650 interviews\nwith company employees over the course of several months.[158] \u201cThis is being\napproached in the way that you would approach a major, systematic criminal\nevent,\u201d said Barrick\u2019s vice-president for security and crisis management.[159]\n\n\n\nBy November 2010, senior company officials appeared to have reached the point\nof accepting that there was a pattern of sexual abuse by some APD\npersonnel.[160]The inquiries by Barrick and the police uncovered at least 13\n\u201cpotential crimes\u201d by APD personnel, apparently separate from the cases\ninvestigated by Human Rights Watch.[161] \u201cWe\u2019ve got some bad eggs and we\u2019re\ngoing to get rid of them,\u201d Mac Grace, Barrick\u2019s Papua New Guinea security\nmanager, told Human Rights Watch, adding that \u201cprocesses were in place but\nsome of those processes weren\u2019t working.\u201d[162]\n\n\n\nIn January 2011 Barrick fired six employees who PJV mine manager Mark Fischer\nsaid were \u201ccredibly implicated in criminal activity, are alleged to have\nmisled investigators, or were aware of these alleged crimes and did not come\nforward.\u201d[163] The company provided records of 30 of those interviews to\npolice investigators.[164] The police subsequently arrested three current and\nformer Barrick employees, charging two of them with rape.[165] At the time,\nthe police stated that additional arrests were likely to follow.[166]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch welcomes the above steps, but emphasizes that\ninvestigations should focus on unearthing broader patterns of abuse, as well\nas ensuring accountability for the incidents described in this report.\n\n\n\nBarrick has taken several measures that could make it easier for community\nmembers to complain about alleged abuses. These are laid out in detail in the\nannex to this report. Key measures include the following:\n\n\n\nBarrick says that a project has been underway since early 2009 to \u201cimprove\nsecurity infrastructure and oversight at PJV.\u201d[174] In December 2010 the\ncompany acknowledged that \u201cThe results of the internal investigation have made\nclear to us that further changes to the security function at Porgera must be\nundertaken.\u201d[175] Barrick has committed itself to several new measures that\nshould strengthen its ability to prevent, monitor, and respond to abuses by\nAPD personnel at Porgera if implemented effectively and in good faith. Those\ncommitments are spelled out in detail in the letter attached as an annex to\nthis report. Key points include the following:\n\n\n\nBarrick also states that it is pursuing \u201cother substantial internal changes\noutside of security.\u201d These include appointing an independent Director to its\nBoard of Directors with expertise in Corporate Social Responsibility and\nenhancing company human rights compliance programs.[190]\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch welcomes these measures, but at time of writing many had\nnot yet been implemented so their effectiveness was impossible to gauge.\nUltimately their value will depend entirely on whether they succeed in\npreventing serious abuses and in bringing abuses to the company\u2019s attention if\nthey do occur.\n\n\n\nA ton of ore-bearing rock yields only a tiny amount of gold. The remaining\nmaterial is processed into tailings, a waste product made up mostly of rock,\nheavy metals, and trace elements of chemicals like cyanide that are used to\nextract the gold. PJV produces roughly six million tons of liquid tailings\nevery year; in 2008 the mine generated almost 9.5 tons of tailings for every\nounce of gold produced.[191]\n\n\n\nPJV discharges its iron-rich tailings into the nearby Porgera River, staining\nits upper reaches a rusty red color. The Porgera River\u2019s water ultimately\nflows into the Strickland River system, one of Papua New Guinea\u2019s longest and\nmost important. Many locals refer to the tailings, and to stretches of the\nPorgera River itself, as \u201cthe red water\u201d and regard it with considerable fear\nand apprehension.[192]\n\n\n\nThe long-term environmental and health impacts of PJV\u2019s riverine tailings\ndisposal have been hotly debated for many years.[193] Critics fear that the\nbuild-up of heavy metals downstream could have unpredictable and potentially\ndangerous consequences for the environment and human health. Before the mine\neven opened, PJV\u2019s plans to employ riverine tailings disposal were publicly\nrejected by Papua New Guinea\u2019s minister of environment and conservation as\n\u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d[194] But the Papua New Guinea government ultimately\napproved the plan in spite of those objections.\n\n\n\nBarrick maintains that, due partly to unique characteristics of the Porgera\nRiver and its surrounding environment, there is no reason to believe the\npractice of riverine tailings disposal at Porgera has or will have any serious\nnegative health or environmental impacts downstream from the mine.[195] \u201cIs\nthere an environmental impact? Sure, you\u2019re not going to hear us say there\nisn\u2019t,\u201d acknowledged Bill Williams, Barrick\u2019s vice-president for the\nenvironment. \u201cBut it\u2019s manageable and it appears to be reversible.\u201d[196]\n\n\n\nCritics vehemently disagree, arguing that PJV\u2019s tailings send potentially\nharmful heavy metals flowing downstream in quantities that far exceed anything\nthat would be permissible under the water quality standards of developed\ncountries, and that the long-term negative effects of riverine tailings\ndisposal in any given context are difficult and perhaps impossible to\naccurately predict.[197] The Norwegian government\u2019s pension fund excluded\nBarrick from its investment portfolio in March 2009 on the recommendation of\nits Council on Ethics, which found that PJV\u2019s practice of riverine tailings\ndisposal carried unacceptable risks of harm to human health and \u201clong-term and\nirreversible environmental damage.\u201d[198]\n\n\n\nThe weight of industry good practice is firmly and clearly against the\npractice of riverine tailings disposal.[199] In fact, Porgera is one of only\nthree large mines in the world run by international companies that still\ndispose their tailings into river systems; all three are on the island of\nPapua.[200]\n\n\n\nIn July 2010, more than a dozen people went to the hospital in Paiam town\nsuffering from chemical burns. According to the hospital\u2019s chief doctor, they\nsaid they had been panning for gold in the mine\u2019s tailing discharge and had\nbeen burned by it.[201] Barrick later said it was investigating whether the\ntailings had not been diluted properly over the course of several days owing\nto a lack of adequate water during a dry spell.[202]\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea has a painful history with riverine tailings disposal gone\nawry. The country\u2019s enormous Ok Tedi copper mine also employs the practice. In\n1999 that project sparked an international scandal when data revealed that\ntailings had overflowed river banks downstream, destroying gardens and killing\nlarge swathes of vegetation. BHP Billiton, the company that owned and operated\nthe mine at the time, pulled out in 1999. Then-Managing Director and Chief\nExecutive Paul Anderson publicly stated that the mine was \u201cnot compatible with\nour environmental values and the company should never have become\ninvolved.\u201d[203] BHP Billiton has since publicly committed not to become\ninvolved in any project that employs riverine tailings disposal.[204]\n\n\n\nPJV has also drawn fire for the way it measures compliance with water quality\nstandards. The company asserts that levels of dissolved metals downstream from\nthe mine are consistently within the range that Papua New Guinean law\nprescribes.[205] But the company measures this at a \u201ccompliance point\u201d that is\n165 kilometers downstream from the mine. By this point the mine\u2019s tailings\nhave been considerably diluted; more than two-thirds of the river\u2019s flow at\nthe compliance point comes from sources untouched by PJV\u2019s operations.[206]\n\n\n\nBarrick maintains that the 165 km between the tailings discharge point and the\ncompliance point constitute a \u201cmixing zone,\u201d a defined area around an effluent\ndischarge point where water quality standards do not apply. Mixing zones are\nstandard practice in the mining industry but they generally constitute much\nsmaller areas, sometimes measured in square meters rather than kilometers. The\nNorwegian government Council on Ethics, recommending that the pension fund\ndivest itself of Barrick stock due to the risk of severe environmental harm at\nPorgera, stated that, \u201cIn the council\u2019s opinion, Porgera\u2019s mixing zone does\nnot constitute a mixing zone in the internationally accepted sense of the\nterm.\u201d[207]\n\n\n\nBarrick defends the size of its mixing zone as legitimate and says that the\nPapua New Guinea government set the compliance point, not PJV. At the same\ntime, the company acknowledges that the current mixing zone is a \u201clarge area\u201d\nand says that it may relocate the compliance point further upstream, but only\nif it is certain the mine will remain within acceptable water quality\nstandards if it does so.[208]\n\n\n\nThis report does not seek to evaluate the likely impact of PJV\u2019s riverine\ntailings disposal on human health or the environment. But concerns about the\npractice are certainly legitimate, and Barrick has displayed a troubling lack\nof transparency in addressing those concerns that it should immediately\nremedy. Recently, the company has expressed some willingness to do just that,\nagreeing to make public its environmental reports to the government. If\nhonored, this commitment will make it more feasible for independent experts to\nevaluate the likely health and environmental impacts of tailings disposal at\nPorgera.\n\n\n\nIn recommending that Norway\u2019s pension fund divest itself of all Barrick stock,\nthe fund\u2019s Council of Ethics cited among other things a \u201clack of openness and\ntransparency in the company\u2019s environmental reporting.\u201d[209] In Human Rights\nWatch\u2019s view, that criticism was directly on the mark.\n\n\n\nUntil September 2010, Barrick consistently refused to make public key data\nthat could allow for independent assessment of its claims regarding the likely\nimpacts of riverine tailings disposal at Porgera especially its periodic\nenvironmental reports to the Papua New Guinea government. Alternative\nindependent sources of data do not exist.\n\n\n\nPJV has facilitated the production of a \u201cStrickland River Report Card\u201d by the\nPorgera Environmental Advisory Komiti (PEAK), a nominally independent body,\nentirely funded by Barrick, mandated to monitor the environmental impact of\nPJV\u2019s operations. The report card contains basic data about overall levels of\nheavy metals at various points along the river. This is a first step in the\ndirection of greater transparency\u2014the first and so far only report card was\nproduced in 2009\u2014but it is only a brochure, with color-coded graphics\ndistilled from the hard data in the company\u2019s environmental reports.[210]\n\n\n\nBarrick monitors potential health and environmental impacts downstream from\nthe mine. The company has commissioned a Health Risk Assessment by an outside\nconsultant that should be completed in early 2011, which it has agreed to make\navailable to Human Rights Watch. It is also undertaking a new study of mercury\nlevels downstream from the mine, which should be completed in late 2012 or\nearly 2013.[211]\n\n\n\nIn September 2010, Barrick agreed to provide Human Rights Watch with a copy of\nPJV\u2019s 2009 environmental report once it has undergone peer review, and to\nprovide a copy of the 2010 report when it is completed as well.[212] At the\ntime of publication the company said that neither document had yet been\nfinalized. Company officials also said that they were in the early stages of\ndeveloping an initiative to regularly publish a broad range of environmental\ndata relating to all of Barrick\u2019s operations, probably on the internet.[213]\nHuman Rights Watch welcomes all of these commitments as important steps in the\ndirection of meaningful transparency around the Porgera mine\u2019s possible\nenvironmental and health impacts.\n\n\n\nBarrick has also not been transparent about its basis for another key\nassertion, its claim that in the case of the Porgera mine there is no viable\nalternative to riverine tailings disposal. PJV has long argued that tailings\ndams (permanent structures that store and isolate mine tailings) are too\ndangerous to use around Porgera because of high seismicity, frequent\nlandslides, illegal miners, and other factors.[214] It is true that safe\nconstruction and maintenance of on-land tailings retention facilities in Papua\nNew Guinea is both technically daunting and expensive.[215] But it is not\nclear whether it is true that no safer methods of riverine tailings disposal\nare feasible at Porgera.\n\n\n\nBarrick commissioned a US$5 million study in 2006 to examine potential\nalternatives to riverine tailings discharge\u2014including construction of a large\ntailings storage facility\u2014and says that the study\u2019s findings indicated that\n\u201c[Tailings storage facility] engineering had not advanced sufficiently since\nthe mine was originally permitted to address these significant risk factors\nand that the operation should not be reconfigured.\u201d[216] But Barrick has\nrefused to make the study itself public; Human Rights Watch urges it to do so\nin order to make independent evaluation of its claims possible.[217] The\ncompany asserts that cost has not been \u201cthe principal factor in determining\ntailings options at Porgera,\u201d but it is not clear exactly what that means, or\nhow much of a factor cost actually constituted.[218]\n\n\n\nSmall-scale and illegal miners around Porgera routinely employ an extremely\ndangerous method of extracting gold from ore-bearing rock using mercury. This\nexposes them, their families, and the communities around them to a very high\nrisk of mercury poisoning.[219]\n\n\n\nThe method small-scale miners around Porgera usually employ to process ore-\nbearing rock is to crush it into a dust, wash as many undesirable rock\nparticles out of the dust as possible, and then pour mercury into the\nremaining material. The mercury binds to any gold present in that material,\ncreating a gold-mercury amalgam that excludes everything else. Miners then\ncook this amalgam over an open flame, causing the mercury to turn into vapor\nand escape into the air.[220] The miners are left with pure gold, which they\ncan sell on the open market.\n\n\n\nThis is an extremely dangerous practice that can damage the brain, central\nnervous system, kidneys, and lungs, as well as lead to psychiatric problems\nincluding wild mood swings and loss of memory and concentration.[221] Unborn\nfetuses and children can suffer developmental problems if exposed to\nmercury.[222] The chief doctor at Paiam hospital said that although his\ninstitution lacks the equipment necessary to test for mercury poisoning, they\nregularly diagnosed cases of mercury poisoning from the severe symptoms of\nmany illegal miners. He said that many patients resembled \u201czombies\u201d by the\ntime they reached the hospital and added that, \u201csome will recover, some will\nnot.\u201d[223]\n\n\n\nMaking matters worse, around Porgera this dangerous method of separating\nmercury from gold is often carried out inside people\u2019s homes, in some cases\nusing the same utensils families use to prepare food. Human Rights Watch\u2019s\nresearcher observed this taking place in several communities all around\nPorgera.\n\n\n\nThe widespread use of these dangerous practices is primarily due to two\nfactors. First, there is widespread ignorance regarding the dire health\nconsequences of current methods of mercury use and the availability of safer\nalternatives. Many illegal miners interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they\nhad heard that mercury could be dangerous but believed they had been working\nwith the substance for so long they were no immune to any negative effect it\nmight normally have. Most interviewees were not aware of safer methods of\ncooking their amalgam, such as using simple retorts that trap mercury vapor\nand condense it back into liquid so that it is not inhaled, or else declined\nto use such methods because they believed that they yielded less gold.[224]\n\n\n\nA second problem is that many people are loath to work with gold outside their\nhomes because they do not want their neighbors to know how much they have.\nHaving broken the law to obtain gold-bearing rock from PJV property in the\nfirst place, many illegal miners also do not want police or APD personnel to\nsee them working with gold.[225]\n\n\n\nShops in Porgera station sell vials of mercury openly. It is not clear that\nbanning the sale of mercury is feasible given the overall lack of law and\norder in the area, and in any case, many local people depend on small-scale\nmining to feed their families. But even if Porgera\u2019s mercury problem has no\neasy or straightforward solution, clear first steps must be taken as a matter\nof urgency:\n\n\n\nCanada is arguably the mining industry\u2019s most important global hub. The\ncountry is a leading producer of several key minerals and home to many of the\nworld\u2019s largest multinational mining companies.[227] But no Canadian law\nprovides a mechanism to allow Canadian authorities to exercise meaningful\nscrutiny and oversight of the human rights impact and compliance of Canadian\nextractive companies operating overseas. On these issues, Canadian companies\noperating overseas generally only have to comply with the laws and regulations\nof the countries in which they work. This often means the bar is set far too\nlow.\n\n\n\nSince gaining independence in 1975, Papua New Guinea has struggled\u2014and largely\nfailed\u2014to build functional institutions of governance. The government is\ncontinually mired in allegations of corruption and mismanagement, while key\npublic institutions such as the police have grown consistently more\ndysfunctional and abusive over time.[228]\n\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinean government also has a long track record of failing to\nadequately regulate the operations of foreign extractives companies, whose\noperations dominate the national economy. For instance in the timber industry\npolitical power and corruption have long combined to ensure the country\u2019s\nenvironmental laws are ignored and rural communities are exposed to\nabuse.[229] Rather than address legitimate concerns around these issues, the\ngovernment has increasingly focused on quashing objections that might stand in\nthe way of new extractive projects.\n\n\n\nIn March 2010 people living near the Chinese-owned Ramu nickel mine filed a\nlawsuit challenging the legality of the project\u2019s plans to construct a\npipeline that would deposit mine tailings in the ocean.The plaintiffs won a\ntemporary injunction halting construction of the pipeline.[230]Parliament\nresponded by passing amendments to the country\u2019s Environment Act that would\nstrip citizens of their right to challenge the legality of large, government-\nsanctioned extractives projects in court.[231] The move triggered widespread\npublic outrage and as of September 2010 the changes had not yet been signed\ninto law.\n\n\n\nThe PNG government\u2019s failure to establish any coherent mechanisms of oversight\nfor private security forces like the APD force in Porgera is emblematic of its\nbroader shortcomings. To the extent that there is any government oversight of\nthe APD force, it rests with police officials in the faraway capital of Port\nMoresby. In practice this means that there is no meaningful, regular\ngovernment oversight of the APD force at all.\n\n\n\nThe police station commander in Paiam town has no oversight role over the\nforce. Asked whether his officers could investigate allegations of abuse or\ncriminality by APD personnel, he replied, \u201cThey would not allow us permission\nto enter the premises\u2026. The company paid for it. They have the right to\nprotect their property. I will never enter the company premises without their\npermission.\u201d[232]\n\n\n\nIla Geno, the respected former commissioner of police and ombudsman whom\nBarrick retained to monitor the conduct of mobile police squads deployed\naround Porgera, told Human Rights Watch that in his view the theoretical\noversight of the APD force by police officials in the capital was\n\u201cimpracticable and very loose.\u201d He advocated that the police give the station\ncommander in Paiam town more responsibility for oversight of the APD force,\nbut he also said that such a move would be useless or worse unless the token\npolice presence in Paiam was bolstered with the capacity it would need to do\nthe job correctly.[233] Barrick officials told Human Rights Watch that the PNG\ngovernment is working on legislation that would install mechanisms to oversee\nprivate security forces in the country, and that the company views that effort\nas positive.[234]\n\n\n\nThe lack of meaningful government regulation and oversight in countries like\nPNG creates a void that could be filled by sensible regulation by\nmultinational companies\u2019 home governments. Canada\u2019s parliament recently\nconsidered and disappointingly rejected a bill that could have been a good\nfirst step in that direction.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch believes that mandatory rules by companies\u2019 home\ngovernments obliging them to respect human rights are an essential safeguard\nthat most governments have yet to implement. Although voluntary initiatives\nlike the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights are supported by\ngovernments and some key industry players, they are not mandatory rules and\ncompliance with them is limited.\n\n\n\nIn Canada, an opportunity for progress was lost in October 2010 when the House\nof Commons narrowly rejected a modest bill called C-300 that would have\nobliged the Canadian government to monitor whether Canadian oil, mining, and\ngas companies complied with basic human rights and environmental standards in\ntheir overseas operations.[235] While the bill included no criminal penalties,\ncompanies that refused to comply with its guidelines would have faced public\ngovernment investigations and the loss of some limited forms of government\nfinancing and consular support.[236]\n\n\n\nMany companies, including Barrick, claim they already adhere to many of the\nstandards incorporated into C-300. But the mining industry lobbied heavily\nagainst the bill, and Barrick vocally opposed its passage.[237] Some industry\nrepresentatives indulged in fanciful scare tactics about the bill\u2019s supposed\npotential to eviscerate the country\u2019s mining industry.[238]Conservative\nmembers of parliament opposed the bill, and C-300\u2019s prospects also suffered\nbecause of the ambiguous position taken by Liberal MP Michael Ignatieff, who\nleads the opposition.[239]\n\n\n\nCanadian oil, mining, and gas companies should have welcomed C-300 rather than\ntreat it as a potential catastrophe. By setting clear standards based on\ninternational norms that many Canadian companies already claim to respect, the\nbill could have saved companies the laborious and complicated task of\ndeveloping those rules on their own.\n\n\n\nCanada\u2019s government must now go back to the drawing board. In theory, a\nconsensus already exists as to what the Canadian policy on these issues ought\nto look like. A 2007 roundtable process that included representatives of both\nindustry and civil society arrived at a series of recommendations about the\nway forward. Those recommendations should all be adopted. The roundtable\nparticipants recommended, among other things, the creation of an independent\nombudsman office to examine complaints against Canadian companies and\nsanctions for non-compliant companies similar to those set down in C-300.[240]\n\n\n\nIn human rights terms, the recommendations of the roundtable advisory group\nare modest, but they represent a good place to start. Unfortunately though,\nthe \u201cconsensus\u201d that appeared to have emerged from the roundtable process may\nbe an illusion. The government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper has done\nlittle to implement the roundtable recommendations, and in particular, has not\ncreated the ombudsman position. Instead, the government created a corporate\nsocial responsibility counselor that has been widely criticized as\nineffectual. Moreover, the fact that industry representatives treated\nprovisions of C-300 that were largely based on the roundtable report as\nanathema has reinforced many analysts\u2019 fears that the industry now intends to\nundermine the consensus it helped forge.\n\n\n\nThe only way to clarify this murky picture is for both of Canada\u2019s major\npolitical parties to spell out in detail where they stand on implementing the\nroundtable recommendations, and what they think a government-led framework to\noversee the human rights records of oil, mining, and gas companies should look\nlike. As of late 2010, neither the Liberal nor the Conservative party had done\nthis.\n\n\n\nThis report was researched and authored by Chris Albin-Lackey, senior\nresearcher in the Business and Human Rights Division.

When Human Rights Watch visited\nPorgera in May 2010 PJV was in the process of constructing a tailings paste\nproduction plant at an estimated cost of $42 million. Paste is easier to\ndispose of safely than liquid tailings in difficult environments like Porgera,\nbut the process can be very expensive. The PJV paste plant, scheduled to be\nfunctioning at the end of 2010, aims to convert \u201cup to ten percent\u201d of the\nmine\u2019s tailings into paste that will be mixed with cement and used to fill up\nunused portions of the mine\u2019s underground operations. Letter from Smare,\nSeptember 7, 2010. PJV asserts that it cannot convert more tailings into paste\nthan this because it has nowhere to store it.
