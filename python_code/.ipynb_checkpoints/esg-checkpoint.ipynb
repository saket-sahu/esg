The federal agency's database shows no other attempts to form a store-wide union at the company, though a group of Home Depot drivers successfully unionized with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 2019.\\n\\nSara Gorman, a Home Depot spokesperson, said the company is aware of the filing and \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153we look forward to talking to our associates about their concerns.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153While we will of course work through the NLRB process, we do not believe unionization is the best solution for our associates,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Gorman said in an email.\\n\\nVincent Quiles, a store employee who is leading the petition, said he delivered the petition with 103 workers' signatures to the federal labor board Tuesday.\\n\\nHe said discontent with compensation and working conditions rose as employees felt strained during the pandemic.\\n\\nQuiles, who makes $19.25 an hour in the receiving department, said he and other workers felt they could have benefited more from the record profits Home Depot made during the pandemic, as demand grew for home improvement projects. He pointed to two bonuses he received last year that amounted to less than $400.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Quiles said his store felt perpetually understaffed, and employees were routinely asked to work in other departments with little training, sometimes angering customers when they could not provide the expertise expected of them.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I would see corporate visits. They would say you're doing a great job, you are so essential. You have to walk the walk. You can't just come in here and say a bunch of nice things,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Quiles said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153This is a long shot but I think we can do this. This is just the beginning.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\n\\nHome Depot, based in Atlanta, employs about 500,000 people at its 2,316 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nWorker discontent has galvanized labor movements at several major companies in the U.S. in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sparked tensions over sick leave policies, scheduling, safety and other issues.\\n\\nIn a surprise victory, Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse voted in favor of unionizing in April, though similar efforts at other warehouses so far have been unsuccessful. At least 238 U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize over the past year, according to the NLRB. Last week, rail workers won key concessions in a tentative agreement with rail companies that averted a potentially devastating shutdown of the nation's freight trains.\",\"ESG_RELEVANT\":1,\"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR\":20.0,\"SCALE\":1.0,\"NATURE_OF_HARM\":2.0,\"COMPANY_NAME\":\"AP\",\"PILLAR\":\"Social\",\"SUB_PILLAR\":\"Labour rights and supply chain\",\"CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT\":4.0,\"STATUS\":0,\"INVOLVED\":0,\"FLAG\":\"Yellow\"},{\"Title\":\"S\\/African court freezes pension payment for graft-accused lottery chief\",\"News\":\"South Africa-Corruption-Lottery S\\/African court freezes pension payment for graft-accused lottery chief\\n\\nAPA-Johannesburg (South Africa)\\n\\nThe Special Tribunal has granted the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) a preservation order to freeze pension benefits of corruption-accused former National Lotteries Commission (NLC) chief operating officer Philemon Letwaba, APA learnt here on Thursday.\\n\\nThe Special Tribunal order interdicts the Liberty Group \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d the pension administrator \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d from paying out pension benefits valued at around R2.8 million (about US$160,000) that is due to Letwaba pending the outcome of investigations into the activities of the former NLC official.\\n\\nThe SIU sought the Special Tribunal\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s intervention to freeze the pension benefits of Letwaba after he resigned from the NLC pending the institution of a disciplinary hearing into his role in the distribution of lottery funds to several non-profit organisations.\\n\\nAn investigation by the SIU in the affairs of NLC had revealed that Letwaba allegedly benefited personally from monies received by the organisations.\\n\\nThe official is alleged to have used friends and family businesses and trusts to receive money from the non-profit organisations for his personal benefit.\\n\\nIn one of the cases, a non-profit organisation based in Limpopo province received approximately R25 million for the refurbishment of a school that had been destroyed by fire.

Compiled by Nicole McIsaac.\\n\\nConnecticut\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s health care industry is becoming increasingly concentrated.\\n\\nIn return, some small private practices in the state are finding it difficult to compete with big health care systems. Instead of struggling to stay afloat, many are joining them.\\n\\nAs of January, hospitals owned 26% of physician practices nationwide, up from 14% a decade ago. An additional 27% of practices were owned by a corporation, leaving fewer than half of physician practices under independent ownership.\\n\\nConnecticut is no exception. Here\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you need to know.\\n\\nHospital mergers are changing the way people in CT receive care\\n\\nIn Connecticut, two systems \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d Yale New Haven and Hartford HealthCare \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d are on the brink of owning more than half the 27 hospitals in the state.\\n\\nToday, the state has six independent hospitals. Only one of Connecticut\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s four rural hospitals remains independent \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d and it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not likely to stay that way.\\n\\nWhile regionalizing health care services in this way can improve the bottom line for hospital systems, it leaves some patients farther away from the medical care they need.\\n\\nService cuts often follow acquisitions. The cuts have had a particularly strong impact on the state\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s rural labor and delivery landscape.\\n\\nLarge hospital systems in CT are also acquiring private practices\\n\\nTogether, the state\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s five health systems account for more than a quarter of the around 17,000 physicians licensed to practice in the state.\\n\\nReports filed to the Office of Health Strategy show that Hartford HealthCare has been acquiring physician practices most actively over the last several years.\\n\\nSince 2015, Hartford HealthCare has acquired 14 practices and 59 doctors, according to publicly available notices of material change.\\n\\nConcentrated health care services can mean higher costs\\n\\nWhen health systems acquire hospitals and small physician practices, it has economic consequences.\\n\\nResearchers have connected hospital consolidation to rising health care costs. That, in turn, has driven up the cost of health insurance plans for many small businesses and nonprofits in Connecticut, who are increasingly struggling to offer health care benefits as rates rise each year \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d often by double digits.\\n\\nResearch has also shown that vertical integration, where hospital systems buy up smaller practices, drives up costs for patients in two ways. First, larger hospital systems are able to negotiate higher rates with insurance companies than private practices for the same level of care. So when a practice gets acquired by a hospital system, its prices go up.\\n\\nSecond, small practices that have become part of a larger health system are more likely to send their patients to hospitals within the system for follow-up services. While convenient \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d the patient\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s records stay within the system \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d the larger system has more power to set higher prices, which can cost the patient more.\\n\\nLawsuit challenges Hartford HealthCare\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s acquisitions as \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u02dcanti-competitive\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122\\n\\nSaint Francis Hospital, owned by Trinity Health of New England, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Hartford HealthCare pushed it out of the market by buying up doctors\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 practices and used certain clauses in its contracts with insurers that drove up health care prices and insurance premiums by limiting options for consumers.\\n\\nHartford HealthCare said its behavior does not qualify as \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153anti-competitive,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d as the lawsuit claims.\\n\\nIn a motion to dismiss the case, Hartford HealthCare\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s lawyers argued that Saint Francis should simply \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153compete harder to recruit and retain physicians.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\n\\nDuring this year\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Connecticut General Assembly session, a bill aimed at rooting out some of the same anti-competitive practices alleged in the lawsuit stalled.\",\"ESG_RELEVANT\":1,\"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR\":28.0,\"SCALE\":1.0,\"NATURE_OF_HARM\":2.0,\"COMPANY_NAME\":\"Yale New Haven\",\"PILLAR\":\"Governance\",\"SUB_PILLAR\":\"Governance\",\"CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT\":4.0,\"STATUS\":2,\"INVOLVED\":1,\"FLAG\":\"Green\"},{\"Title\":\"Here are the Trump properties at the center of the New York attorney general\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s lawsuit against the former President and his family\",\"News\":\"CNN \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James on Wednesday filed a civil fraud lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, three of his children and his business.\\n\\nIn more than 200 pages, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former President used to enrich himself, and that the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses.\\n\\nHere\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a breakdown of some of the notable properties mentioned in the lawsuit:\\n\\n1.

Now, the Suisse Secrets project reveals that the company's parent firm poured money into Swiss bank accounts held jointly by its employees and African elites, including a Nigerian spy chief.\\n\\nKEY FINDINGS:\\n\\nFour employees of AOG, an investment group linked to a bribery scandal in Nigeria, held joint Credit Suisse accounts with political figures from West and Central Africa.\\n\\nThe account holders included Umaru Ali Shinkafi, a former Nigerian spy chief and associate of military ruler Sani Abacha.\\n\\nThe opening dates and maximum balances on the accounts mirror the rise of AOG subsidiary Addax Petroleum, the firm at the heart of the bribery scandal.\\n\\nShinkafi at one point held a stake in AOG that was never made public.\\n\\nIn May of 1998, an obscure company called Addax Petroleum came from nowhere to take Nigeria's oil industry by storm, scoring one of the most lucrative deals the country had ever seen.\\n\\nDespite having no record in oil extraction, Addax scooped up four valuable oil exploration and production licenses. The deal set off a spectacular rise for the Swiss-based firm, which was registered on the tiny Caribbean island of Cura\\u00c3\\u00a7ao. After going public in 2006, it was sold three years later to China's state oil giant for $7.2 billion.\\n\\nYears later, a French court case uncovered some of the hidden reasons behind the company's sudden success: Addax executives testified that they had paid $5 million in bribes into the Swiss bank account of Nigeria's oil minister during the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha, who ruled the West African nation for five years after seizing power in a 1993 coup.\\n\\nThe payments, testimony showed, were made to secure the oil licenses of Ashland Inc., an American energy firm that had fallen into dispute with Nigerian authorities. Addax had also set up Swiss accounts for Mr Abacha's two oldest sons, and used Swiss banks to funnel millions in illicit \\\"commissions\\\" to Nigerian officials, the case showed.\\n\\nNow, OCCRP has uncovered new evidence that executives at the Addax and Oryx Group (AOG), the investment firm that owned Addax, maintained secret financial ties with politicians in West and Central Africa as Addax prospered. Like the bribes, this money was also routed through the Swiss banking system.\\n\\nAmong those to benefit were Umaru Ali Shinkafi, a former Nigerian spy chief whose ties to the company were not publicly reported. Mr Shinkafi also held a valuable stake in AOG by 2015, according to a share register obtained by OCCRP.\\n\\nOlanrewaju Suraju, a Nigerian anti-corruption activist and chairman of Human and Environmental Development Agenda, said that given Addax's track record of bribery to people surrounding the Abacha government, it was possible the newly discovered accounts were also intended as payments for government officials.\\n\\nIn total, four employees of Addax and AOG held five joint accounts with these politicians at Credit Suisse, starting as early as the mid-1990s according to the leaked Suisse Secrets data. Some remained open well into the last decade. The account-holders included one of Mr Shinkafi's long-time associates, as well as multiple political figures in Senegal and the Republic of the Congo, countries where Addax and AOG also operated.\\n\\nThe first joint account, which had eleven signatories, was opened in 1994, the same year Addax Petroleum was founded. The account was worth 62 million Swiss francs ($53.32 million) in 2005, the year Addax incorporated in Canada and paid out tens of millions of dollars in its first publicly disclosed dividends.\\n\\nThe following year, shortly after Addax listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the same eleven people opened four new Credit Suisse accounts together.\\n\\nAOG acknowledged that the bank accounts existed, but said they were \\\"not secret accounts but rather bank accounts which were opened, held and operated by AOG group entities and which have been used for usual business purposes,\\\" including to pay out dividends or carry out share buybacks.\\n\\nThey said the individuals on the accounts had become AOG shareholders for \\\"modest amounts,\\\" either as part of an incentive programme for employees and directors or at their issued nominal value during the company's first fundraising round. At the time, \\\"none of them was holding a political mandate,\\\" the company said.\\n\\nDavid M\\u00c3\\u00bchlemann, a financial and legal expert at Swiss NGO Public Eye told OCCRP that AOG's explanation about the joint accounts was not convincing, noting that there are other, more standard ways of paying dividends.\\n\\n\\\"It's easy to transfer money from one account to another. It's not magic to do that,\\\" Mr M\\u00c3\\u00bchlemann said.\\n\\n\\\"At first glance, I can hardly think of legitimate purposes why AOG should hold joint accounts with high-ranking political figures.\\\"\\n\\nThe Suisse Secrets Investigation\\n\\nSuisse Secrets is a collaborative journalism project based on leaked bank account data from Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse.\\n\\nThe data was provided by an anonymous source to the German newspaper S\\u00c3\\u00bcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared it with OCCRP and 46 other media partners around the world. Reporters on five continents combed through thousands of bank records, interviewed insiders, regulators, and criminal prosecutors, and dug into court records and financial disclosures to corroborate their findings. The data covers over 18,000 accounts that were open from the 1940s until well into the last decade. Together, they held funds worth more than $100 billion.\\n\\n\\\"I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,\\\" the source of the data said in a statement. \\\"The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders. This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue.\\\"\\n\\nBecause the Credit Suisse data obtained by journalists is incomplete, there are a number of important caveats to be kept in mind when interpreting it. .\\n\\nCredit Suisse, in a statement, insisted that Swiss law does not authorize it to comment on client relationships.\\n\\n\\\"As publicly stated in our press release published on 20 February this year, we have taken a series of significant measures over the last decade, in line with financial market reforms, to combat financial crime. Our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business,\\\" the bank said.\\n\\nMr Shinkafi died in 2016. His daughter and son-in-law did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nAddax's History of Bribery\\n\\nAOG was founded in 1987 in Geneva by four Swiss businessmen and registered in the British Virgin Islands. The firm started out trading refined oil products and then moved into storing and distributing oil products in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1994, AOG founded Addax Petroleum as a subsidiary for oil exploration and production.\\n\\nThough it was an oil firm on paper, Addax's first activities in Nigeria were dedicated to helping Mr Abacha and his associates set up financial infrastructure to receive millions of dollars' worth of bribes, according to later court findings.\\n\\nWorking on a tip from France's Finance Ministry, French investigators would later find that Richard Granier-Deferre, a French-born Addax Petroleum executive in Geneva, had opened accounts on behalf of Abacha's two oldest sons at Banque Edouard Constant in Geneva in 1995. He also set up an account for Bukazi Etete, the brother of Nigeria's oil minister Dan Etete.\\n\\nIn January 1997, Addax transferred $920,000, described as \\\"hidden commissions,\\\" into Mr Etete's brother's account to win a contract for delivery of refined Nigerian oil products from the state's oil company, according to court records.\\n\\nAddax was not alone in making such payments: Nine companies, including Britain's Attock Oil International and the Swiss commodities trader Glencore, also paid money into Bukazi Etete's account. In total, some $19 million and roughly 5.5 million German marks passed through the account between 1995 and 1997, records show.\\n\\nMr Granier-Deferre maintained power of attorney over Mr Etete's Swiss accounts, which he used to move deposits into Addax's own Swiss accounts. In Nigeria, Addax would then pay out the same amounts in cash to officials, he said.\\n\\nBanque Edouard Constant closed the accounts in 1997, after numerous suspicious deposits, including a $12 million transfer sent in a single day to Mr Abacha's sons' account. Undeterred, Granier-Deferre opened new accounts for the group at other Swiss banks. One such account was at Credit Suisse. Opened under the name \\\"Omoni Amalfegha,\\\" a known alias for Dan Etete, it was soon filled with $3 million in transfers. (This account did not appear in Suisse Secrets data.)\\n\\nMessrs Granier-Deferre and Dan Etete were eventually both convicted of aggravated money laundering -- Etete in absentia -- and received prison terms which were converted to fines on appeal.\\n\\nAll in all, Mr Granier-Deferre estimated, Addax had paid Etete some $10 million in bribes. The biggest of these, $5 million, related to the purchase of the Ashland assets, which set off the company's rapid ascent in Nigeria.\\n\\nStolen Nigerian Assets in Switzerland\\n\\nThe Addax bribery affair was not the only instance of tainted Nigerian money ending up in Switzerland.\\n\\nIn 2000, Swiss financial authorities reprimanded Credit Suisse for accepting over $200 million in deposits from former Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha's sons, although none of these accounts appeared in Suisse Secrets data.\\n\\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Swiss authorities repatriated $723 million that had been illicitly acquired by the family of General Abacha. Again in 2017, the Swiss authorities returned to Nigeria $321 million tied to the Abacha family.\\n\\nTaking Ashland's Assets\\n\\nIn 1973, Ashland Nigeria Exploration Unlimited, a subsidiary of Ashland Inc., became the first company to enter into a so-called \\\"production-sharing contract\\\" with Nigeria's state-run oil company.\\n\\nBut in 1997, after nearly two and a half decades of operation, Ashland fell afoul of Nigerian authorities when it tried to sell shares in its Nigerian subsidiaries to a French company without getting government approval.\\n\\nMr Etete, the oil minister, had reportedly wanted to kill the Ashland contract, but Addax executives managed to convince him this would be bad publicity. Instead, Addax would negotiate with Ashland to buy out its Nigerian assets.\\n\\nAddax secured Ashland's licenses for four oil fields in southeastern Nigeria in April 1998. The amount paid was not disclosed, but Ashland's earlier agreement with the French firm valued the assets at $60 million.\\n\\nWith the lucrative licenses in hand, Addax grew quickly. By 2005, it was Nigeria's largest independent oil producer, churning out over 65,000 barrels of crude per day and bringing in nearly $470 million a year in revenues.\\n\\nThe same year, Addax paid out $85 million in dividends to its shareholders, and shelled out another $50 million before its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed in February 2006, valuing the company at over $2 billion. AOG also gave out about eight per cent of its remaining shares in Addax -- worth roughly $160 million at the time -- to current and former directors and employees.\\n\\nAs these windfalls were arriving for both AOG and Addax investors, a Credit Suisse account co-owned by eleven people -- including four AOG employees and various African political figures -- swelled in value. In March 2005, the account hit its maximum value of 62 million Swiss francs, worth about $53.32 million at the time.\\n\\nBetween March and April 2006, four new Credit Suisse accounts were opened in the names of the same eleven people. None reached more than 1 million Swiss francs in value, apart from one worth over 2.5 million francs in 2014.\\n\\nTwo accounts -- including the largest one -- were closed in 2009, the same year that Chinese state oil giant Sinopec bought Addax. A third was closed in 2013, while two others appeared to remain open well into the last decade.\\n\\nNames on the Accounts\\n\\nThe five Credit Suisse accounts had eleven signatories, including four AOG employees and various political figures from West and Central Africa. OCCRP identified the following account holders:\\n\\nMoustapha Niasse, Senegal's former foreign minister and national assembly president from 2012 to 2022. Niasse denied knowledge of these accounts but said he was a founding shareholder of AOG in 1987 and exited the company in 2006 after Addax was listed on Toronto Stock Exchange.\\n\\nMaurice Nguesso, elder brother of president of Republic of the Congo, or Congo-Brazzaville. He did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nDominique Nimi Madingou, a Congolese politician. Madingou died last year.\\n\\nUmaru Ali Shinkafi, a former Nigerian spy chief and presidential aspirant, whose son-in-law Atiku Bagudu was a key money launderer for Abacha.\\n\\nAhmed Kusamotu, a long time associate of Shinkafi, who was a political party chairman in early 1990s.\\n\\nAbdoulaye Diao, a wealthy Senegalese oil merchant with close ties to the country's top political leaders. His son, Moussa Diao, is currently head of Oryx Energies, an AOG subsidiary.\\n\\nLourenco de Almeida, a trading manager with AOG until 2009.\\n\\nAli Kewe Ndiaye, a trader with AOG until 2009.\\n\\nMamadou Ciss, senior vice president at AOG until 2006.\\n\\nFranklin Jackson, an AOG employee.\\n\\nShinkafi's Secret Share\\n\\nThe Nigerian spy boss Umaru Shinkafi, whose name has never been publicly connected to AOG or Addax, was a signatory to all five Credit Suisse accounts.\\n\\nA former police officer, Mr Shinkafi became the head of the National Security Organization - now known as the State Security Service - in 1979. He held the post until about a month before the civilian government was ousted in a military coup in 1983.\\n\\nMr Shinkafi unsuccessfully ran in the primaries as a would-be presidential candidate under the National Republican Convention, one of two political parties approved by the military government to contest the 1993 presidential elections.\\n\\nThe elections, which Mr Shinkafi's party candidate eventually lost, were annulled by then President Ibrahim Babangida. Soon, General Abacha had re-taken military power. Mr Shinkafi's leadership dream was in tatters, but Nigeria's return to military rule produced another high-level connection for him. Mr Shinkafi's son-in-law, Atiku Bagudu, became a key money launderer for the Abachas, helping them clean billions, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Today, Mr Bagudu is governor of Nigeria's northwestern Kebbi State.\\n\\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Legal Affairs Nigeria By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

All the while, he was also accumulating shares in AOG. According to a share register obtained by OCCRP, Mr Shinkafi owned 500 of the company's \\\"class A\\\" shares in 2015, the year before he died.\\n\\nAOG told OCCRP that Mr Shinkafi was an early minority shareholder and never owned more than 0.27 per cent of the company's shares. They said they were never aware of his association with Mr Abacha or his political activities.\\n\\n\\\"He was known to us as a businessman specialized in the oil and gas industry at that time and was not known to the group for his political activities,\\\" they wrote.\\n\\nTax Evasion Charges\\n\\nIn 2014, the past finally caught up with Addax when the Nigerian government under President Goodluck Jonathan accused the company of evading over $3 billion in taxes and royalty payments. Authorities demanded the firm pay back taxes stretching to 2000, just before then President Olusegun Obasanjo's administration granted the company special tax cuts.\\n\\nAddax sued the Nigerian government in December 2014, arguing that as a result of receiving the tax cuts they had invested heavily in the Nigerian economy, amounting to even more than $3 billion.\\n\\nFor unclear reasons, Nigerian authorities agreed to settle the matter out of court and eventually agreed to abide by the earlier agreement. But this was not the end of Addax's troubles.\\n\\nIn 2016, Deloitte, Addax's auditor, reported the company had paid $100 million to lawyers, consultants, and other entities in Nigeria the previous year with no clear services or products rendered, according to a copy of a letter to Sinopec obtained by OCCRP.\\n\\nDeloitte resigned as Addax auditor in December 2016 after the audit firm insisted on an external independent investigation into the payments. Swiss authorities later arrested Addax's chief executive officer and legal director in Geneva on bribery charges. Three weeks later, both were released without charge. A few months later, the company paid 31 million Swiss francs to settle the case.\\n\\nIn 2017, U.S. investigators opened their own probe into Addax's owner since 2009, the Chinese state firm Sinopec, since parts of the payment passed through the U.S., according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nThen, last year, Nigeria's oil regulator revoked the four oil mining licenses Addax had obtained from Ashland, claiming they had failed to develop the assets for years. The president, Muhamadu Buhari, restored the licenses, ostensibly to protect the rule of law and a stable business environment, although some saw it as a move to avoid angering China.\\n\\nNevertheless, authorities continued to press their claim for back taxes. Today the government is still in court, demanding that Addax pay over $3 billion.\",\"ESG_RELEVANT\":1,\"PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR\":25.0,\"SCALE\":1.0,\"NATURE_OF_HARM\":1.0,\"COMPANY_NAME\":\"Suisse Secrets\",\"PILLAR\":\"Governance\",\"SUB_PILLAR\":\"Governance\",\"CONTROVERSY_ASSESSMENT\":1.0,\"STATUS\":2,\"INVOLVED\":1,\"FLAG\":\"Yellow\"},{\"Title\":\"Tether: Bitcoin inflation probe takes new turn; can USDT withstand the pressure\",\"News\":\"Tether [USDT] seems to have returned to hitting the rocks.
