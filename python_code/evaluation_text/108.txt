BOGOTA (Reuters) – Colombian coal miner Cerrejon, owned by Anglo-Swiss
commodities giant Glencore, said on Saturday that a group of former workers
has been blocking a rail line to a key export facility on the Caribbean Coast.



Blockades on roads and rail lines around the open pit mine in La Guajira – one
of the largest in Colombia, which produced 23.4 million tons of coal last year
– are not uncommon.



In a statement, Cerrejon said the employees were let go more than 20 months
ago but are demanding to get their jobs back.



The rail line is used to transport coal to a key export facility, Puerto
Bolivar.



The blockade is resulting in a daily loss of more than 22 billion pesos ($4.58
million) in income tax, the company said in a statement, and is putting at
risk the jobs of more than 11,000 workers and contractors.



“We are a company open to dialogue… but we have come across a small group of
people who are making unreasonable demands,” said Luis Eduardo Marulanda, vice
president of public affairs, in the statement.



Colombia is a major world exporter of coal, producing 53.5 million tons last
year alone, and the mineral is one of the most important sources of income.
