"â€œVegas is Vegas.â€

Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray was allegedly struck with an open hand while celebrating with fans after his teamâ€™s 20-point comeback victory over the Raiders on Sunday.

The quarterback was high-fiving fans and getting hugs when a hand came down on his face from the second row.

Las Vegas police are investigating the matter, but Murray said he had no hard feelings for the individual.

â€œStuff happens fast,â€ Murray told reporters Wednesday. â€œI know every person that Iâ€™ve hit in the face, I did it for a reason. I donâ€™t know if he probably didnâ€™t know where he was. I donâ€™t know. It was a pretty live game. Vegas is Vegas. Iâ€™m sure he was having fun.

â€œBut, again, I donâ€™t think any player should be getting touched in that manner.â€

Murray said he would even shake the individualâ€™s hand.

â€œIt is what it is.â€

The Cardinals beat the Raiders on a walk-off fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by cornerback Byron Murphy Jr.

Murray was visibly amped, celebrating with teammates after the situation near the stands.

He said without a doubt heâ€™d go up to the fans all over again in a similar situation."
