Advanced-Connectek has made unglamorous but critical computer components for
Apple for more than a decade. For two of those years, it operated a factory
inside an industrial park on the edge of the deserts of Xinjiang, a region of
western China populated by a predominantly Muslim group known as Uyghurs. The
industrial park is surrounded by walls and fences with only one way in or out.



And next to the park was a large compound identified by a satellite imagery
researcher as a detention center where the factory workers lived. The
researcher, Nathan Ruser, from an Australian think tank, said “almost no other
factories in Xinjiang have these characteristics except for industrial parks
where there is detainee labor.”



The Information and human rights groups have found seven companies supplying
device components, coatings and assembly services to Apple that are linked to
alleged forced labor involving Uyghurs and other oppressed minorities in
China. At least five of those companies received thousands of Uyghur and other
minority workers at specific factory sites or subsidiaries that did work for
Apple, the investigation found.



The revelation stands in contrast to Apple’s assertions over the past year
that it hasn’t found evidence of forced labor in its supply chain.
