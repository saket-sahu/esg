On April 12, 2019, a California federal jury awarded $6 million to Walmart
workers at a Chino, California warehouse who worked as “Associates” as far
back as June 8, 2013. During meal breaks, Walmart required Associates to go
through a lengthy “asset protection” process that included an anti-theft metal
detector checkpoint if they wished to leave the warehouse at lunch. The
process took so long that it would significantly cut into Associates’
30-minute lunch breaks, and Associates feared that they would have no time to
clock back in upon returning from break. As a result, Associates at the
warehouse felt “like criminals,” and avoided leaving the premises for their
breaks. The California federal jury found that Walmart: (1) failed to provide
more than 1,900 employees with proper meal breaks, and (2) discouraged those
employees from enjoying those breaks outside of the building.



California State law provides employees with a 30-minute meal break for every
5 hours worked. Additionally, California employees must be allowed to take
their meal break off-work premises and spend it however they see fit. If an
employer fails to provide an employee with a proper meal break, the employer
shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at an employee’s regular
rate of compensation. Employees who believe that they are not being provided
proper meal breaks, or are subject to other workplace violations, should seek
legal counsel to analyze their potential legal claims.
