The Federal Trade Commission has charged Gerber Products Co., also doing
business as Nestlé Nutrition, with deceptively advertising that feeding its
Good Start Gentle formula to infants with a family history of allergies
prevents or reduces the risk that they will develop allergies.



The agency also alleges that Gerber has falsely advertised Good Start Gentle’s
health claims as FDA-approved. Through its federal court enforcement action,
the Commission is seeking to prohibit Gerber from making the alleged false and
unsubstantiated allergy-prevention claims.



“Parents trusted Gerber to tell the truth about the health benefits of its
formula, and the company’s ads failed to live up to that trust,” said Jessica
Rich, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Gerber didn’t have
evidence to back up its claim that Good Start Gentle formula reduces the risk
of babies developing their parents’ allergies.”



In its complaint, the FTC alleges that since 2011, Gerber has advertised its
Good Start Gentle formula through advertisements that ran on television, in
magazines, at point-of-sale displays, online, and in other promotional
material. Good Start Gentle sells for about $24 for a 23.2-ounce package of
powdered formula.



Good Start Gentle is made with partially hydrolyzed whey proteins (PHWP).
Gerber claims that feeding babies this formula, instead of formula made with
intact cow’s milk proteins, will prevent or reduce the risk that they will
develop allergies. In its ads, Gerber promotes Good Start Gentle by saying,
for example:



Also, a sticker on the package states that Good Start Gentle Formula is the:



The agency’s complaint charges that Gerber lacked the scientific
substantiation to make these general allergy-prevention claims, in violation
of the FTC Act.



In addition, according to the FTC, Gerber’s ads also misrepresent that Good
Start Gentle has qualified or received approval for a Food and Drug
Administration health claim. For example, some ads prominently featured a gold
badge stating that Good Start Gentle is the “1st and Only” formula that “Meets
FDA Qualified Health Claim.”



In 2009, Gerber petitioned the FDA for permission to make a claim connecting
PWHP with the reduced risk of _one_ type of allergy, atopic dermatitis, in
infants. The FDA allowed Gerber to make the narrow claim but only if Gerber
carefully qualified its statement to make it clear that there is “little
scientific evidence” for the relationship.



The Commission vote authorizing staff to file the federal court complaint was
5-0. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of
New Jersey on October 29, 2014.



 **NOTE:** The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe”
that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission
that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the
court.



The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent,
deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help
spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, visit
