WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it is
recalling 361,000 older vehicles worldwide for potentially defective air bag
inflators.



The defect involves a different type of Takata inflator than those that have
prompted the largest-ever auto safety recalls worldwide covering more than 42
million U.S. vehicles by 19 automakers with Takata air bag inflators.



Honda Motor Co 7267.T said on Tuesday it will recall 2.7 million older U.S.
vehicles in North America for the same type of Takata inflator that Toyota is
also recalling. Takata issued a new defect notice in November for inflators
from four automakers, including Honda and Toyota.



Toyotaâ€™s new recall covers some 1998-2000 Toyota RAV4, 1998-1999 RAV4 EV,
1998-1999 Celica and 1997-1998



Model Year Supra vehicles with a non-azide front driver airbag inflator,
including 139,000 in the United States.



The notice came after BMW recalled more than 200,000 vehicles in the United
States for the same type of inflator after the death of a driver in Australia
from an air bag rupture involving one of the inflators, along with two other
injury incidents in Australia and Cyprus.



In total, at least 25 people have been killed and 290 injured from the
inflators, which can explode when deployed and spray deadly metal fragments.
U.S. regulators say the cause of the inflator explosions is propellant
breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and
humidity.
