Volkswagen Group faces mounting pressure to address allegations of human
rights violations in the Chinese province of Xinjiang, where the German
automaker operates a car factory.



While there is no evidence that anyone has been mistreated at the VW plant,
the company should carefully examine the accusations, said supervisory board
members Joerg Hofmann, a labor leader, and Stephan Weil, who represents VW's
key shareholder Lower Saxony.



“We have to concretely weigh the facts and on this basis answer the question
if a termination of the activity there would be the right thing,” Hofmann told
the _Braunschweiger Zeitung_ in an interview, citing potential damage to VW's
reputation.



VW has fielded uncomfortable questions about its suppliers and operations in
Xinjiang, where human rights groups and a panel of United Nations experts have
raised concerns about coercive labor practices.



China has repeatedly rejected criticisms of the work programs, calling
allegations of forced labor lies and defending its policies as an effort to
reduce poverty and unemployment.



VW Group CEO Herbert Diess has defended the company's presence in the region,
telling U.S. TV news program 60 Minutes in April he's “absolutely sure” there
is no forced labor at VW's plant, and that locals “are much better off” if the
company stays put.



China is Volkswagen's biggest market, accounting for roughly 40 percent of
sales.



Volkswagen is “firmly opposed to forced labor,” Nicolai Laude, a company
spokesman, said Friday. “In our worldwide business activities, we ensure that
our values are lived and our standards are upheld. We expect the same from our
local business partners.”



The automaker is also facing pushback from the German government. Berlin
recently declined a Volkswagen request to renew risk insurance for the
company's Chinese operations over the human rights concerns, according to a
person familiar with the matter.



It's the first time Berlin has rejected such a bid and shows a shift in tone
on China, which became Germany's biggest non-EU trading partner over the past
two decades.



German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last month called out alleged abuse at detention
for ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang and called on companies to do more to diversify
their supply chains and export markets.
