The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Citigroup Global Markets
Limited (Citigroup Global Markets) £12,553,800 for failing to properly
implement the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) trade surveillance requirements
relating to the detection of market abuse.



By failing to properly implement the MAR trade surveillance requirements,
Citigroup Global Markets could not effectively monitor its trading activities
for certain types of insider dealing and market manipulation.



MAR was introduced in 2016 and expanded requirements to detect and report
potential market abuse. It introduced a requirement to monitor both orders and
trades to detect potential and attempted market abuse across a broad range of
markets and financial instruments.



However, the FCA found that Citigroup Global Markets failed to properly
implement the new requirement when it took effect, and took 18 months to
identify and assess the specific market abuse risks its business may have been
exposed to and which it needed to detect. Citigroup Global Markets’ flawed
implementation resulted in significant gaps in its arrangements, systems, and
procedures for additional trade surveillance.



Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight,
commented:



‘The framework for market integrity depends on the partnership between the FCA
and market participants using data to detect suspicious trading. By not fully
implementing the new provisions when required, Citigroup Global Markets did
not carry its full weight in this partnership, impacting market integrity and
the overall detection of market abuse.’



Citigroup Global Markets agreed to resolve this case and qualified for a 30%
discount. Without this discount, the fine would have been £17,934,030.
