SANTIAGO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - A Chilean court ordered BHP’s Cerro Colorado
copper mine on Thursday to stop pumping water from an aquifer over
environmental concerns, according to filings seen by Reuters.



The same First Environmental Court in July ruled that the relatively small
copper mine in Chile’s northern desert must start again from scratch on an
environmental plan for a maintenance project.



The court on Thursday called for “precautionary measures” that include ceasing
groundwater extraction for 90 days from an aquifer near the mine.



The court said the measures were necessary to prevent adverse effects from
pumping from becoming more acute.



Copper miners across Chile, the world’s top producer of the red metal, have
been forced in recent years to find alternative means to feed water to their
operations as drought and receding aquifers have hampered prior plans. Many
have sharply reduced use of continental freshwater or turned to desalination
plants.



BHP did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the court’s
decision.



A ruling in January by Chile’s Supreme Court upheld local indigenous
communities’ complaint that the environmental review process had failed to
consider concerns about the project’s impacts on natural resources, including
the regional aquifer.
