FRANKFURT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) on Monday said markets
were too jittery for a fast listing of its hydrogen division Nucera,
confirming that an initial public offering (IPO) for the business was still
the favoured scenario.



"Even though we currently consider the capital market environment to be rather
unfavourable for a quick IPO, an IPO of tk nucera remains the preferred
option," the company said when asked about whether conditions had changed in
the wake of the planned IPO of Porsche.



"We continue to monitor developments closely."
