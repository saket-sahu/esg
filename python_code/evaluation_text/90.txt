MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Reuters) - Mexican national oil company Pemex said one
person was dead and another missing on Friday after an "incident" caused by a
storm at the Madero refinery in the state of Tamaulipas.



Lightning caused a truck on site to burst into flames, Pemex said in a
statement, causing an oil well to also catch on fire.



Around 6:30 a.m. Friday morning, the body of an employee of contractor Amarelo
Power was found, Pemex said, while an employee of contractor GMG was missing.
